Hello

How are you doing?

We absolutely loved this slime. It’s super pretty with tons of metallic shine but not glitter that gets everywhere. The slime isn’t all sticky and goopey…it’s more together and so it makes no mess. It’s not super crazy stretchy, but I like that my girls can play with it without getting it all stuck in their hair or my carpet if it drops. The packaging was really on point too, and my girls loved popping open each globe to get their slime. We put them in goodie bags for my 6 year old’s bday, and everyone loved them!I have purchased these twice now to put in gift bags for my kids birthday parties. You cant go wrong with slime, always a kid fav and these provide good quality and value.

My second time purchasing these. Got for my 13yo’s and now for my 5yo’s party. Slime is always a big hit!

I put these in party gift bags kids love them

My kids loved the slime and it's not messy.

Very awesome kit I must say and was a nice gift for a child.

Product is great

We bought two boxes of these to give away at a kids party and they worked out perfectly. This is the good slime, the kind that doesn't make a mess but is still slimy.

Recommending!

I bought this for a bday gift for a child w/ sensory issues because of the reviews. They were not wrong. The child loved it, the mom approved. If I could change one thing, I wish it was sold in larger containers. The 24 containers are very small. They ended up opening and placing in one large one.

I got them to hand out to the kids of parents I don't like for Halloween once this slime dries its never really all coming off I would recommend I buy them all the time for this

I really appreciate the slime the most because it didn’t stick to my furniture. I don’t know how they did it but it’s the best slime we’ve ever had in our house. Also, it’s really cute colors very futuristic.

Decent quality slime but these ones don’t come labeled either, once they’re out the box they’re apparently easily confused for bouncy balls. Smashed casing and upset kids for sure

These were perfect for birthday favor bags and Halloween treats! Great value.

Small for kid's gift bags. Not sticky and easy to clean after.  Looks nice in container however it turns brown once they play with it.

Kids love the slime. The colors were lit

Great quality

Bought these as party favors and had some left over that my kids glooped all together. Good consistency slime, no scent.

Gave these out as party favors for my son's 7th birthday ONLY because they were stretchy and beautiful and did NOT stick to my hands or my table. Highly recommend.

Took them to my job, nurse on ortho neuro floor. All the employees, and some patients loved them. Great stress reliever but they are difficult to get out  of fabric. Just have to be careful

Great item that can be used in so many ways! Easter egg hunts, Easter Baskets, Party Favors, and Christmas stockings! Great price on a a lot. Kids love slime.

"The media could not be loaded.I did like the colors but it clumps instead of stretching"

i used these as fillers in the goody bags for my daughters birthday. They did help filler the bags and my daughter loved them. I had extras to keep at home for my other kids. I love the value a lot of party favors dont come with 25+. its always 12 or 10 or 20. I always want to avoid having to buy 2 of an item and just use 2 or 3 from the pack. I was glad this came with more than enough

The slime was very pretty and kept its galaxy look even after played with.It wasn’t super stretchy but it was jiggly.It didn’t stick to anything,And is the perfect amount for a classroom exchange/goodie bag gift.

This is definitely worth the price for as many slimes as you get and they all came nice and securely packaged so it wasn't a slime cover mess when I opened the box which I was pleasantly surprised about. I bought these to use in goodie bags for my kids birthday party and I'm sure it will be a hit, especially with the galaxy colors. Overall I would recommend for at home play, goodie bags, or even a fun classroom treat.

Perfect for a kids' birthday party!

This was a big hit as party favors for ages 5-13 really! Big kids love slime for some reason and are still amused with it and little kids can’t get enough of the stuff. I’m not a big fan of the container because if it breaks the slime willDry up. As a parent I am thrilled with this slime as it doesn’t get stuck on the couch or on walls like other types of slime does!

Love the texture of this slime. It doesn't stick to your hands or other objects. Purchased these for toddler gift bags and they were a huge hit! Came perfectly packaged and all were very colorful. If the slime comes apart after handling for awhile, just stick it back in the container and it will congeal again after 10 minutes. The colors will eventually run together making a purple/grayish color after playing with it about a dozen times, but that is expected. My toddler still finds it fun to play with.

this was the perfect party favor for my daughters birthday party!

Great party favor for a wide range of ages 3-13

Such an awesome party favor! The little slime balls also had little ducks, pearls and cute things inside the slime! Totally worth it! My son was very happy!

It is a Galaxy looking slime that does not get mixed up.  But maintained its colors.

Perfect party favor

Excellent product!!!!!!!  My son gave these out in his party bags at school.  Item was boxed nicely and each slime was sealed which was even better for the schools rules with covid!  My kids loved playing with the slime!  Colors were beautiful!!  I will definitely order this product for additional parties etc!

I gave these out to my students in the class prize box. They were definitely a favorite.

I cannot rave enough about these! I used them in my sons favor bags for his birthday. They are about the size of a golf ball. The slime doesn’t stick to anything ESPECIALLY carpet or hair. If it is left out, it does harden, which is fine because in my opinion he should have taken better care of it!! The box came with a few that had little trinkets in the slime which was really cool!!

This Slime is awesome! The kids loved it and it was individually sealed so you don’t have to worry about it going bad if you don’t use it quickly! It wasn’t too sticky like some slime can be! It did start to come apart a little after the kids played with it for awhile but that’s to b expected!

I cringe at the idea of slime, but with three daughters ranging from ages 3 to 8, it is almost unavoidable. What I like about this slime is the texture. It can change shapes but isn’t slimy and sticky where it gets stuck on fabric, clothes or carpet. The sphere container it comes in is reusable for easy storage. I gave them away as part of the grab bag goodies for my daughters’ birthday.

The kids loved finding slime in the Easter eggs. There was a good mix of different colors.  As a mom, I appreciate that the ball stays closed and doesn't leak slime on my furniture 😊

All parents cringed when they saw these little slimes in the gift boxes at my son’s birthday party, but thanksfully they were pleased that they were not sticky or messy at all.

These are small little slimes but they were perfect for my elementary schooler. The color is beautiful as shimmery and they do not smell weird like other slimes which is great.

Good quality for the kids. After they played with it, they could put it back in the ball and it turn right back to the original shape!!

Got these to add to my daughters goody bags. We opened one right away and the slim was perfect. My daughter said it feels so nice and it does. Also feels like non messy too which is great !

It came in a nice sturdy box and very neat for the kids

Purchased for birthday party gift bags. The slime is a thicker consistency than most ‘slime.’ Each ball was wrapped in plastic and hard to remove but the slime itself was great for all ages. 3-13

Love this slime!  I bought it to give out to my son’s class. It’s not messy or sticky, so it’s an easy clean up!  Leaves my boys occupied for a while. I definitely recommend this slime!

I used the slime during my summer camp. It was easy to handle and wasn't sticky. This made for good, clean fun for the kids.

Love that it’s not sticky, but it does tear apart way too easily. Was hoping it would be a little like silly putty, but still awesome.

This slime is great. It doesn’t stick to other stuff and get nasty. And surprisingly smelled awesome as well. I Bought them as party favors and got another box for Christmas just to have on hand.

My kids love it but is slight messy for me to clean.  You know what you are buying. This really isn’t a surprise.

I wasn't sure at first if this slime would be a good present for my 3yr old daughter because alot of slimes are very sticky and messy but surprisingly this slime isn't its super easy to clean up and the colors are very pretty and it's cool to the touch

Supper fast shipping. I ordered it to give out as prizes to children in our church kids program.

My grandson loves this stuff and this one made him so happy.  I recommend

This sticky party gift was bought for the kids. You can stretch and pull the mucus by squeezing, and it's very depressurized. Non sticky mucus, super elastic, soft, non-toxic, safe, can let children rest assured to play. It's worth buying.

My kids like playing with this slime. I like it because it isn’t a gooey mess. Almost like putty, but stretchier and softer/more moist. Cool colors too.

I had very low expectations and ended up being really impressed! These were for my daughters birthday party goodie bags. Each slime has some sort of theme, is not sticky and the balls hold the slime again after opened (which I didn’t expect). The slime isn’t sticky or runny...good stuff for the right price!

This sticky, soft, moist Galaxy mucus is of good quality and doesn't smell bad. It can let children experience the fun of mixing, matching and color changing, and bring endless fun and experience for children. It's worth buying.

I bought them for my son's class and my advisory (I'm a teacher) for Valentine's-- they are super tiny (about a quarter's width and only a tiny glob of slime, but perfect for what i was using it for! The high schoolers in my advisory loved them!

Bought for my great nephew and he loved it.

Ordered this slime for Valentine gifts for our kids classes. I’m tired of trying to come up with cute ideas. My kids are 7 and 11 and love slime, so why not gift it to their friends! My daughter loves the galaxy colors! Valentines is easy and done this year!

Used these for Easter gift baskets and they were a hit - no complains.

I like the colors and that there are many of them. This is a gift for my granddaughter and she hasn't received them yet so I am sure she will be pleased and very surprised.

Good price for the number of slime balls in the package. Package is also very pretty and inside the slime balls are well organized. I am going to use them to put inside goody bags for my sons party. I am sure the kids will love how vibrant the color of the slime is. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase.

The color mixes were not all the same, which was good. Kids loved them and adults did too. A parent asked if we had extras because they wanted one to play with.

It was perfect for my daughters 8th birthday. I liked that it wasn’t runny.

Great quality and the prettiest slime I've seen! Kids (and adults) loved it at the birthday party!

Kids loved them i do aswell lol..

Each one came in a plastic ball case.  Not all looked like planets.  Some were a clear like color with random plastic fruit pieces inside.  They looked very nice and has a nice putty feel to it. Not too slimy and not sticky.  My kids loved it.

Best slime. My daughter was amazed and the little guests too.

Used them for classroom stocking stuffers.  The kids loved them and my daughter was proud to pass them out.  She asked us to purchase them again for her birthday favor bags. They came quickly and were very well packaged.

The students in my class are all ways crazy for slime! I got this for treasure box! They can never get enough!

Got these to add to my kids goody bag. She insisted that we give out slime for her birthday. They came nicely packed in a box. Each slime was contained in a plastic ball. The kids were excited to receive these. Not extra sticky and didn't get stuck to everything.

"The media could not be loaded.Very small amount, good for birthday party goodies bags."

Great slime. Cool color combinations and not messy like other slime types.

Ordered this for an end of the year gift. Waited almost 2 weeks for it to finally ship. Was no disappointed! The presentation was beautiful! My daughter picked the first one out of the box and the slime itself didn’t have a residue and was great for play. Would order again!

Great for pinata stuffers. Great quality amd packaging - was a huge hit for kids of all ages.

Bought this for some birthday party favor bags.  The consistency is similar to $ Tree slime.  Some reviewers had issues where some of the containers spilled during shipment.  Mine came perfect... which is good because I need all 24! HA!

Great size for child Goodie bags

these were a valentines day pass out. Just the right size and sealed ip very well so the kiddos could transport them home in their backpacks without worry of them opening.

Great birthday party gift bag items

Used as a party favor figure all kids lik slim nice & tiny fit right n gift bag

Great party gift. Kids loved the cosmic swirl of colors

These went into my classroom treasure box and were a huge hit immediately gone with my third greatest. Good quality, intense and no transfer color. The spherical shape of the container is unique and enjoyed by the students as well.

It's a great deal, and the stuff inside is soft and doesn't stick to your hands.It used to be valuable to buy in the supermarket

gave these out to trick or treaters in my neighborhood and kids loved them! Only thought would be to have individual labels on them, adults thought they were bath bombs and several kinds thought they were bouncy balls!

These were a hit as Easter eggs this year for my 14, 9, and 7 year olds! With everything di crazy I love that these brought hours of joy.

This was an amazing deal for the price! I originally got them to put in a piñata, but they were too big for that. When we gave them out at the party, the kids loved them

My daughter loves giving these to her classmates. Cute product for kids.

I purchased these for the Valentine's Day exchange at my daughter's school.  I printed labels that said "Happy ValenSLIME Day" and they were a hit!  Great value and pretty colors.

Great Birthday favors

The kids at my stepsons 4th bday party loved it! We have to hide it from him because kids get slime everywhere, but he loves the texture and to watch it jiggle lol

Great for kids birthday party party gifts !

I ordered these for my grandkids and they loved them.My son said, "they are cool"!I bought the set of 24 for them to share.  I guess I picked a cool gift this time. 😁

These are great sensory experiences.. cool, a little bit tacky (sensation) but not sticky, stretchy, malleable, can break apart if pulled quickly and then meld back into itself; it's good stuff.

Purchased for a birthday party favor bag for 5 year old.  Kids loved them!  For the price point they're really high quality.  They're not the sticky type, which I was happy about.

Kids loved it

These were great for party bags. No mess or sticky residue. The kids enjoyed playing with them.

The packaging was great! The kiddos loved them! I would order this again! Thank you!

My son loves the texture .. and they are not messy at all..

Great product. The kids love if. Don't let kids play on carpet.

Was a hit

Good fun

Awesome!

Amazing product. The kids loved it.

Super cute and perfect amount of slime for no mess

Bought this for my 4th grader to use as valentines.  They were perfect and the kid loved them!

This slime is so cool! The containers are super small though but perfect as party favors

We actually bought these for gifts for Valentine’s Day for my kiddo’s class. They were a hit.

These are really cute, I haven't opened them yet as they are gifts but they're too cute. The children will love them!

My son gave these out for Valentine’s Day party. It was a big hit with the kids.

Very pretty galaxy-like slime. It is still slime and get stuck in everything (hair, carpet, rug).

Muy bonitos

Great quality, not sticky or messy at all. Kiddos in my daughter's class loved these.

Not sticky, best slime for little ones!!

Purchase these for gift bags for my daughter’s birthday party.  The slime isn’t super sticky.  Overall a great purchase

Great party favors

Awesome favor.

Great !!!

great

Ordered for party favors. The kids loved them and they’re not messy

This was great for party favors for my daughter's birthday party. The kids absolutely loved the slime and easy clean up off surface.

Perfect for a kid party

My granddaughter wanted to give galaxy slime to her classmates for Valentines. After reading many reviews I chose these. I saw that there were a few unhappy reviews but I took a chance hoped for the best. First it arrived early then expected Yea! I took the box out of the delivery bag and said a little prayer that they would be OK. Well when I opened the box they were beautiful!!! My two granddaughter couldn't wait to get I to them. We counted out enough for her class and they attacked the rest! They are very happy with the product. 👍 The "slime" really is more of a putty. Which I prefer. If you pull it apart fast it will break like a putty. The girls have been pulling it slowly and it will stretch like a slime. It's just not like traditional slime but the girls are very happy and enjoying the slime with items inside it. I would buy this again.

For a birthday party, kid loved it gave out as party favors

I got these for a kid’s party to put in the piñata and the kids loved them! The slime is great! Fit easily in the opening to the piñata. This was my error, but I should have taped them shut cause we did the piñata on concrete so a few broke open. On grass they would have been fine. Super happy with this purchase and my daughter was extatic!

My granddaughter loves all things slime, a slime expert she says. She loves this, the colors reminded her of the Aurora borealis. So not sticky, supper easy clean up, awesome slime!

My kids love it. I most definitely will buy this again.

These were also another hit for my son’s 8th bday in the goody bags and all the kids loved them! The parents did also since this alone does NOT stick to anything! Which I might also add means it is very slippery. But again, it does NOT stick to carpet, couches, clothing, or anything! And when some fell on the floor and got dirty, they washed them with a little water and they were brand new! Definitely buying these again!

These were great . I purchased these for my sons class to put in his bday treat bags . They were colorful and the texture for sensory was great and not like putty where it sticks to things and you can’t remove it . Loved the colors.

I usually avoid slime because it gets all over the place.  This product really isn’t sticky as advertised.  It’s not as stretchy, but I’ll take less stretch for something not sticky.  Perfect for kids party favor bags.

Great gift bag item

Kids love this slime. Any mom would hate it. Leaves a grease film on table, clothes.

Worth the money

Great party favor, perfect size and variations of color

My son gave these to his Kindergarten class for his bday! It was a big hit, kids love slime!

Super cute!!! They are a lot smaller than expected but works perfectly for the party gift bags I intend to use them for!

I used this product to put in the goodie bags for my sons birthday and it was nice kids loved it

Love the colors, the amount, the price and it is great for goody bags!

Fun for kids.

These were cute and loved by the kids.

Beautiful

"The media could not be loaded.Very happy with the product. I am putting these in goodie bags for my daughter’s kindergarten class. There is a row of slime that is not galaxy. I didn’t expect that, but it is fine. I will not use them all and will have some left over. The slime consistency is perfect for kids as it is thick and not sticky. It does stretch without breaking. I would purchase again."

These were a great addition to birthday goody bags. Kids loved them! They were bigger than expected.

Out of this world, grandkids lived and so did grown ups.

My girl likes it. Another great gift for stay home kids.

I bought this for treat bags and it was a hit! All the kids loved it! I love that it isn’t sticky and wet like other slime.

Bought these as items for my prize box and my students loved them. Yes they are small, but it was enough for them and they liked it.

"The media could not be loaded.I like it. It's fun to play with in my hands. Did I read fully before buying nope. Which lead to a slight disappointment that it does not stretch. But that my fault for not reading the whole page.It's a great find tho. I love it and the the kids will too!!!"

EXCELENTE PRODUCTO

Great party favors, they have a clean smell to them, so many different types and color assortment, it's some of the best slime I've ever felt, love that they come in a little plastic ball!

This product was perfect as trinkets to add towards the VDay & Easter Baskets that I made. The kids enjoyed them and asked for more. The slime has good stretch, soothing to play with, and was great value for the money. I would definitely repurchase!

Kids love slime these days and this is a neat one to give good amount not too much but not too little. Colors are awey

"The media could not be loaded.I got them as party favors for my girls 6th birthday and the kids loved them! They were not super slimey but they sure are fun and worth it."

Muy lindos los compré para la fiesta de cumpleaños de mi hija

This is a great value party favor

It’s gelly and my baby loves it. I love it too

2nd year in a row purchasing for favor bags! Not dry and they're the perfect filler for the price. Cant beat a 24 pack!

These are great for goodie bags at kids birthday parties. They’re so fun because there’s so many different colors to choose from and they’re all different. It was fun for my son to open the plastic ball and figure out what was inside. The putty is soft and stretchy but doesn’t get sticky or stain. When you roll it into a ball and set it down, it slowly flattens out. It even bounces a little... pretty cool!

Really cool slime! We got it for stocking stuffers for my daughters class, the kids were excited and my daughter has loved playing with it.

The packaging is neat and just right for party favors. The actual product is fantastic. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽The swirl of colours dont muddy and continue to sparkle all how you squeeze and play. Cool to the touch. Grown me couldnt get enough. I know the children will be ecstatic.

Highly satisfied with this purchase. My 4 year old loved that he gave these to his friends and got to keep some. It doesn't leave a residue on your skin and is easily contained.

Prefect for party goodie bags . Mini size.

I got these as a nice reward alternative for my students instead of candy treats. They love them, the parents are happy I am not providing sugary treats, but I did get some interesting looks for choosing slime that can easily escape, from some of the moms. You win some, you lose some. I would rather have the kids happy and trying harder for this prize at the end of the day. 😄

Colorful

They're what I expected. Small cups of slime for what ever reason you may need them for. No issues when opened or anything else at this time.

These were awesome Party favors in my son's birthday goodie bags! The kids loved them, they even had little items in the slime like little duckies and stars.

Kids loved it. At first they thought it was a ball, but were even happier when they realized it was slime.

Bought these for my daughter’s 10th bday party and they were a hit! The kids loved how you could lay it on a shirt sleeve and it wouldn’t stick, ha! Small but seemed to be a nice size for the kids. Very pretty design/colors, would order again!

They looked so much bigger than expected but they where used

I bought it before my child's birthday and put it secretly in her schoolbag on her birthday. My baby likes it very much, and her friends also like it very much. It's a very good shopping!I will continue to buy it next time and recommend it to everyone

I'm very happy and my kidos are going to so happy.

Great for party giveaways

We absolutely loved this slime. It’s super pretty with tons of metallic shine but not glitter that gets everywhere. The slime isn’t all sticky and goopey…it’s more together and so it makes no mess. It’s not super crazy stretchy, but I like that my girls can play with it without getting it all stuck in their hair or my carpet if it drops. The packaging was really on point too, and my girls loved popping open each globe to get their slime. We put them in goodie bags for my 6 year old’s bday, and everyone loved them!

I have purchased these twice now to put in gift bags for my kids birthday parties. You cant go wrong with slime, always a kid fav and these provide good quality and value.

My second time purchasing these. Got for my 13yo’s and now for my 5yo’s party. Slime is always a big hit!

I put these in party gift bags kids love them

My kids loved the slime and it's not messy.

Very awesome kit I must say and was a nice gift for a child.

Product is great

We bought two boxes of these to give away at a kids party and they worked out perfectly. This is the good slime, the kind that doesn't make a mess but is still slimy.

Recommending!

I bought this for a bday gift for a child w/ sensory issues because of the reviews. They were not wrong. The child loved it, the mom approved. If I could change one thing, I wish it was sold in larger containers. The 24 containers are very small. They ended up opening and placing in one large one.

Great quality

Bought these as party favors and had some left over that my kids glooped all together. Good consistency slime, no scent.

Gave these out as party favors for my son's 7th birthday ONLY because they were stretchy and beautiful and did NOT stick to my hands or my table. Highly recommend.

Took them to my job, nurse on ortho neuro floor. All the employees, and some patients loved them. Great stress reliever but they are difficult to get out  of fabric. Just have to be careful

Great item that can be used in so many ways! Easter egg hunts, Easter Baskets, Party Favors, and Christmas stockings! Great price on a a lot. Kids love slime.

"The media could not be loaded. I did like the colors but it clumps instead of stretching"

The slime was very pretty and kept its galaxy look even after played with.It wasn’t super stretchy but it was jiggly.It didn’t stick to anything,And is the perfect amount for a classroom exchange/goodie bag gift.

Love the texture of this slime. It doesn't stick to your hands or other objects. Purchased these for toddler gift bags and they were a huge hit! Came perfectly packaged and all were very colorful. If the slime comes apart after handling for awhile, just stick it back in the container and it will congeal again after 10 minutes. The colors will eventually run together making a purple/grayish color after playing with it about a dozen times, but that is expected. My toddler still finds it fun to play with.

this was the perfect party favor for my daughters birthday party!

Great party favor for a wide range of ages 3-13

Such an awesome party favor! The little slime balls also had little ducks, pearls and cute things inside the slime! Totally worth it! My son was very happy!

It is a Galaxy looking slime that does not get mixed up.  But maintained its colors.

I gave them away as part of the grab bag goodies for my daughters’ birthday.

The kids loved finding slime in the Easter eggs. There was a good mix of different colors.  As a mom, I appreciate that the ball stays closed and doesn't leak slime on my furniture 😊

All parents cringed when they saw these little slimes in the gift boxes at my son’s birthday party, but thanksfully they were pleased that they were not sticky or messy at all.

These are small little slimes but they were perfect for my elementary schooler. The color is beautiful as shimmery and they do not smell weird like other slimes which is great.

Good quality for the kids. After they played with it, they could put it back in the ball and it turn right back to the original shape!!

Got these to add to my daughters goody bags. We opened one right away and the slim was perfect. My daughter said it feels so nice and it does. Also feels like non messy too which is great !

It came in a nice sturdy box and very neat for the kids

Purchased for birthday party gift bags. The slime is a thicker consistency than most ‘slime.’ Each ball was wrapped in plastic and hard to remove but the slime itself was great for all ages. 3-13

Love this slime!  I bought it to give out to my son’s class. It’s not messy or sticky, so it’s an easy clean up!  Leaves my boys occupied for a while. I definitely recommend this slime!

I used the slime during my summer camp. It was easy to handle and wasn't sticky. This made for good, clean fun for the kids.

Love that it’s not sticky, but it does tear apart way too easily. Was hoping it would be a little like silly putty, but still awesome.

This slime is great. It doesn’t stick to other stuff and get nasty. And surprisingly smelled awesome as well. I Bought them as party favors and got another box for Christmas just to have on hand.

My kids love it but is slight messy for me to clean.  You know what you are buying. This really isn’t a surprise.

I wasn't sure at first if this slime would be a good present for my 3yr old daughter because alot of slimes are very sticky and messy but surprisingly this slime isn't its super easy to clean up and the colors are very pretty and it's cool to the touch

Supper fast shipping. I ordered it to give out as prizes to children in our church kids program.

My grandson loves this stuff and this one made him so happy.  I recommend

This sticky party gift was bought for the kids. You can stretch and pull the mucus by squeezing, and it's very depressurized. Non sticky mucus, super elastic, soft, non-toxic, safe, can let children rest assured to play. It's worth buying.

My kids like playing with this slime. I like it because it isn’t a gooey mess. Almost like putty, but stretchier and softer/more moist. Cool colors too.

I had very low expectations and ended up being really impressed! These were for my daughters birthday party goodie bags. Each slime has some sort of theme, is not sticky and the balls hold the slime again after opened (which I didn’t expect). The slime isn’t sticky or runny...good stuff for the right price!

This sticky, soft, moist Galaxy mucus is of good quality and doesn't smell bad. It can let children experience the fun of mixing, matching and color changing, and bring endless fun and experience for children. It's worth buying.

I bought them for my son's class and my advisory (I'm a teacher) for Valentine's-- they are super tiny (about a quarter's width and only a tiny glob of slime, but perfect for what i was using it for! The high schoolers in my advisory loved them!

Bought for my great nephew and he loved it.

Ordered this slime for Valentine gifts for our kids classes. I’m tired of trying to come up with cute ideas. My kids are 7 and 11 and love slime, so why not gift it to their friends! My daughter loves the galaxy colors! Valentines is easy and done this year!

Used these for Easter gift baskets and they were a hit - no complains.

I like the colors and that there are many of them. This is a gift for my granddaughter and she hasn't received them yet so I am sure she will be pleased and very surprised.

Good price for the number of slime balls in the package. Package is also very pretty and inside the slime balls are well organized. I am going to use them to put inside goody bags for my sons party. I am sure the kids will love how vibrant the color of the slime is. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase.

The color mixes were not all the same, which was good. Kids loved them and adults did too. A parent asked if we had extras because they wanted one to play with.

It was perfect for my daughters 8th birthday. I liked that it wasn’t runny.

Great quality and the prettiest slime I've seen! Kids (and adults) loved it at the birthday party!

Kids loved them i do aswell lol..

Each one came in a plastic ball case.  Not all looked like planets.  Some were a clear like color with random plastic fruit pieces inside.  They looked very nice and has a nice putty feel to it. Not too slimy and not sticky.  My kids loved it.

Best slime. My daughter was amazed and the little guests too.

Used them for classroom stocking stuffers.  The kids loved them and my daughter was proud to pass them out.  She asked us to purchase them again for her birthday favor bags. They came quickly and were very well packaged.

The students in my class are all ways crazy for slime! I got this for treasure box! They can never get enough!

Got these to add to my kids goody bag. She insisted that we give out slime for her birthday. They came nicely packed in a box. Each slime was contained in a plastic ball. The kids were excited to receive these. Not extra sticky and didn't get stuck to everything.

"The media could not be loaded.Very small amount, good for birthday party goodies bags."

Great slime. Cool color combinations and not messy like other slime types.

Ordered this for an end of the year gift. Waited almost 2 weeks for it to finally ship. Was no disappointed! The presentation was beautiful! My daughter picked the first one out of the box and the slime itself didn’t have a residue and was great for play. Would order again!

Great for pinata stuffers. Great quality amd packaging - was a huge hit for kids of all ages.

Bought this for some birthday party favor bags.  The consistency is similar to $ Tree slime.  Some reviewers had issues where some of the containers spilled during shipment.  Mine came perfect... which is good because I need all 24! HA!

Great size for child Goodie bags

these were a valentines day pass out. Just the right size and sealed ip very well so the kiddos could transport them home in their backpacks without worry of them opening.

Great birthday party gift bag items

Used as a party favor figure all kids lik slim nice & tiny fit right n gift bag

Great party gift. Kids loved the cosmic swirl of colors

These went into my classroom treasure box and were a huge hit immediately gone with my third greatest. Good quality, intense and no transfer color. The spherical shape of the container is unique and enjoyed by the students as well.

It's a great deal, and the stuff inside is soft and doesn't stick to your hands.It used to be valuable to buy in the supermarket

gave these out to trick or treaters in my neighborhood and kids loved them! Only thought would be to have individual labels on them, adults thought they were bath bombs and several kinds thought they were bouncy balls!

These were a hit as Easter eggs this year for my 14, 9, and 7 year olds! With everything di crazy I love that these brought hours of joy.

This was an amazing deal for the price! I originally got them to put in a piñata, but they were too big for that. When we gave them out at the party, the kids loved them

My daughter loves giving these to her classmates. Cute product for kids.

I purchased these for the Valentine's Day exchange at my daughter's school.  I printed labels that said "Happy ValenSLIME Day" and they were a hit!  Great value and pretty colors.

Great Birthday favors

The kids at my stepsons 4th bday party loved it! We have to hide it from him because kids get slime everywhere, but he loves the texture and to watch it jiggle lol

Great for kids birthday party party gifts !

I ordered these for my grandkids and they loved them.My son said, "they are cool"!I bought the set of 24 for them to share.  I guess I picked a cool gift this time. 😁

These are great sensory experiences.. cool, a little bit tacky (sensation) but not sticky, stretchy, malleable, can break apart if pulled quickly and then meld back into itself; it's good stuff.

Purchased for a birthday party favor bag for 5 year old.  Kids loved them!  For the price point they're really high quality.  They're not the sticky type, which I was happy about.

Kids loved it

These were great for party bags. No mess or sticky residue. The kids enjoyed playing with them.

The packaging was great! The kiddos loved them! I would order this again! Thank you!

My son loves the texture .. and they are not messy at all..

Great product. The kids love if. Don't let kids play on carpet.

This slime is so cool! The containers are super small though but perfect as party favors

We actually bought these for gifts for Valentine’s Day for my kiddo’s class. They were a hit.

These are really cute, I haven't opened them yet as they are gifts but they're too cute. The children will love them!

My son gave these out for Valentine’s Day party. It was a big hit with the kids.

Very pretty galaxy-like slime. It is still slime and get stuck in everything (hair, carpet, rug).

Muy bonitos

Great quality, not sticky or messy at all. Kiddos in my daughter's class loved these.

Not sticky, best slime for little ones!!

Purchase these for gift bags for my daughter’s birthday party.  The slime isn’t super sticky.  Overall a great purchase

Best slime

Perfect party favors

Great party favors

Awesome favor.

Great !!!

great

Ordered for party favors. The kids loved them and they’re not messy

This was great for party favors for my daughter's birthday party. The kids absolutely loved the slime and easy clean up off surface.

Perfect for a kid party

My granddaughter wanted to give galaxy slime to her classmates for Valentines. After reading many reviews I chose these. I saw that there were a few unhappy reviews but I took a chance hoped for the best. First it arrived early then expected Yea! I took the box out of the delivery bag and said a little prayer that they would be OK. Well when I opened the box they were beautiful!!! My two granddaughter couldn't wait to get I to them. We counted out enough for her class and they attacked the rest! They are very happy with the product. 👍 The "slime" really is more of a putty. Which I prefer. If you pull it apart fast it will break like a putty. The girls have been pulling it slowly and it will stretch like a slime. It's just not like traditional slime but the girls are very happy and enjoying the slime with items inside it. I would buy this again.

For a birthday party, kid loved it gave out as party favors

I got these for a kid’s party to put in the piñata and the kids loved them! The slime is great! Fit easily in the opening to the piñata. This was my error, but I should have taped them shut cause we did the piñata on concrete so a few broke open. On grass they would have been fine. Super happy with this purchase and my daughter was extatic!

My granddaughter loves all things slime, a slime expert she says. She loves this, the colors reminded her of the Aurora borealis. So not sticky, supper easy clean up, awesome slime!

My kids love it. I most definitely will buy this again.

These were also another hit for my son’s 8th bday in the goody bags and all the kids loved them! The parents did also since this alone does NOT stick to anything! Which I might also add means it is very slippery. But again, it does NOT stick to carpet, couches, clothing, or anything! And when some fell on the floor and got dirty, they washed them with a little water and they were brand new! Definitely buying these again!

These were great . I purchased these for my sons class to put in his bday treat bags . They were colorful and the texture for sensory was great and not like putty where it sticks to things and you can’t remove it . Loved the colors.

I usually avoid slime because it gets all over the place.  This product really isn’t sticky as advertised.  It’s not as stretchy, but I’ll take less stretch for something not sticky.  Perfect for kids party favor bags.

Great gift bag item

Kids love this slime. Any mom would hate it. Leaves a grease film on table, clothes.

Worth the money

Great party favor, perfect size and variations of color

My son gave these to his Kindergarten class for his bday! It was a big hit, kids love slime!

Super cute!!! They are a lot smaller than expected but works perfectly for the party gift bags I intend to use them for!

I used this product to put in the goodie bags for my sons birthday and it was nice kids loved it

Love the colors, the amount, the price and it is great for goody bags!

Fun for kids.

These were cute and loved by the kids.

Beautiful

"The media could not be loaded.Very happy with the product. I am putting these in goodie bags for my daughter’s kindergarten class. There is a row of slime that is not galaxy. I didn’t expect that, but it is fine. I will not use them all and will have some left over. The slime consistency is perfect for kids as it is thick and not sticky. It does stretch without breaking. I would purchase again."

These were a great addition to birthday goody bags. Kids loved them! They were bigger than expected.

Out of this world, grandkids lived and so did grown ups.

My girl likes it. Another great gift for stay home kids.

I bought this for treat bags and it was a hit! All the kids loved it! I love that it isn’t sticky and wet like other slime.

Bought these as items for my prize box and my students loved them. Yes they are small, but it was enough for them and they liked it.

"The media could not be loaded.I like it. It's fun to play with in my hands. Did I read fully before buying nope. Which lead to a slight disappointment that it does not stretch. But that my fault for not reading the whole page.It's a great find tho. I love it and the the kids will too!!!"

EXCELENTE PRODUCTO

Great party favors, they have a clean smell to them, so many different types and color assortment, it's some of the best slime I've ever felt, love that they come in a little plastic ball!

This product was perfect as trinkets to add towards the VDay & Easter Baskets that I made. The kids enjoyed them and asked for more. The slime has good stretch, soothing to play with, and was great value for the money. I would definitely repurchase!

Kids love slime these days and this is a neat one to give good amount not too much but not too little. Colors are awey

"The media could not be loaded.I got them as party favors for my girls 6th birthday and the kids loved them! They were not super slimey but they sure are fun and worth it."

Muy lindos los compré para la fiesta de cumpleaños de mi hija

This is a great value party favor

It’s gelly and my baby loves it. I love it too

2nd year in a row purchasing for favor bags! Not dry and they're the perfect filler for the price. Cant beat a 24 pack!

These are great for goodie bags at kids birthday parties. They’re so fun because there’s so many different colors to choose from and they’re all different. It was fun for my son to open the plastic ball and figure out what was inside. The putty is soft and stretchy but doesn’t get sticky or stain. When you roll it into a ball and set it down, it slowly flattens out. It even bounces a little... pretty cool!

Really cool slime! We got it for stocking stuffers for my daughters class, the kids were excited and my daughter has loved playing with it.

The packaging is neat and just right for party favors. The actual product is fantastic. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽The swirl of colours dont muddy and continue to sparkle all how you squeeze and play. Cool to the touch. Grown me couldnt get enough. I know the children will be ecstatic.

Highly satisfied with this purchase. My 4 year old loved that he gave these to his friends and got to keep some. It doesn't leave a residue on your skin and is easily contained.

Prefect for party goodie bags . Mini size.

I got these as a nice reward alternative for my students instead of candy treats. They love them, the parents are happy I am not providing sugary treats, but I did get some interesting looks for choosing slime that can easily escape, from some of the moms. You win some, you lose some. I would rather have the kids happy and trying harder for this prize at the end of the day. 😄

Colorful

They're what I expected. Small cups of slime for what ever reason you may need them for. No issues when opened or anything else at this time.

These were awesome Party favors in my son's birthday goodie bags! The kids loved them, they even had little items in the slime like little duckies and stars.

Kids loved it. At first they thought it was a ball, but were even happier when they realized it was slime.

Bought these for my daughter’s 10th bday party and they were a hit! The kids loved how you could lay it on a shirt sleeve and it wouldn’t stick, ha! Small but seemed to be a nice size for the kids. Very pretty design/colors, would order again!

They looked so much bigger than expected but they where used

I bought it before my child's birthday and put it scustomer_review

I like the turn knob this one has better than the lift knobs for controlling the pressure. A self cleaning nozzle is a good thing.

I have high water pressure in my house. With that said, I was expecting a linear reaction from the pressure knob. I did not get one. The first dot was nice. The second gave me a second hole in. I am too afraid to turn it up to max because it might send the universe into an alternate dimension. Be careful, I now have PTSD when someone turns on a sink or hose.

It doesn't have heated water but you get used to that. It works really well. Use on low power to start. Anything above that I would call DEEP CLEANING mode. Saves paper and promotes better hygiene.

I have owned 3 of these bidets and buy one everywhere I move. I even jokingly bought one for a friend telling him if he doesn't like it its free! He venmo'd me the money the day it arrived after saying it was a life changing experience

I had high hopes for this unit given the ratings, but alas--for me this thing is a clunker. First, the okay aspects: It was easy to install, and the price is reasonable. However, the price does not seem as reasonably priced when you factor in the second aspects.  Just after 2-3 weeks the spray became very erratic to the degree that there really isn't a position you can shift your hind quarters so that the spray would be precise. I tried cleaning the spout considering that maybe hard water was perhaps the issue. Regrettably, that did not alleviate the problem. I have given up using it and will look to a unit that has some adjustability.

No Media

Installed for a handicapped lady. EZ to install, and she states that, "It is easy to use, and has a self cleaning feature."

Easy install and works as intended.

I am just blown away at the comfort and quality of this bidet!!!Let's just say I'm'instructionally challenged. The installation instructions were simple, concise and easy to follow. I have never installed anything involving plumbing fixtures, and I had it set up in only about ten minutes, and didn't feel like I wasn't understanding any part of the process. It is very, very user friendly.My work restrooms are equipped with extremely expensive, top of the line bidets, and this bidet is JUST as comfortable as the super expensive ones. There is no difference in cleanliness, water control or comfort between this bidet and a super pricey one.Overall, if you're looking for a more hygienic restroom experience, and looking into cutting down on toilet paper usage (because let's face it, it feels like sandpaper these days anyway), the Luxe Bidet will not disappoint you! You'll wonder how you ever waited so long to have one. I cannot live without a bidet.

This is a must have! No if ands or butts about it!! ??

The bidet is great quality and the company stands behind it. I had a unit start leaking after 16.5 months. It was just from hard water deposits, nothing wrong with the product itself. They sent me a new unit free of charge!

Easy to install and makes cleanup a breeze post bears. Best money spent in a long time

Easy enough to install, everything needed is included with quick delivery by Amazon.Travel overseas and it was so common and see how convenient to use which makes me want one.This particular model had a lot of reviews and price point is great.Glad I got this!

I wish I would've bought a bidet attachment with a male and female setting. That is more worth it. This one just has one specific angle that you have to sit just right for. Or dance around until you reach it. Also my toilet seat doesn't sit right (there was a FAQ booklet that offered assistance but it didn't help me). If I could I'd return it and get a different one. Best thing was the easy install.

Good quality for the price

Works good

Life changing. Absolutely required in my life now

I don't know how I survived for this long without one! I bought several family members one for Christmas and now they've come to the dark side too!

If you don't have a bidet, get one. Changes your life for the better. Have no complaints about this.

I like it. But I think it aims a little high

It's irritating that it doesn't come with seat spacers, you have to order those separately.

Works great and took about 10 minutes to install.

I got the luxe bidet. It was easy to install! The hardest thing was taking the toilet seat off! I wish I had of gotten 1 of these yearsssss ago! Feels great to be clean every time after you use it! ahhhhhh......

Really wasn't sure if I would like using a bidet but I love it! No more toilet paper waste all the time. It cleans you up so well, no mess after! Took a few times to get used to the cold as it doesn't have a temp. Control but you get used to that. Great purchase for the price!

Wow what an amazing product!! Squeaky clean in one shot!!

My daughter had previously ordered two for her bathrooms. While visiting she talked me into trying it out. I've been hooked every since. I've both two for my home and have been telling all my family and friends to buy one. Cuts down tremendously on toilet paper use

I'm really happy with the Bidet.  It was really easy to install.  I have only had this for about a week.  I don't need to turn it on beyond the first dot.  It puts out a pretty intense stream of water. Wished I would have purchased one a long time ago.The disappointment was the Bidet box was not inside another, so when it was delivered to the office, they knew what I ordered.  I recommend checking, it's a gift during check out.

Its great but the pressure isn't good enough at least for me it does a pretty good job really easy to install

Everyone needs one of these.  Love it

Surfs up. Seriously, it works better than I expected.

I loved this bidet when I first got it. But after only a few weeks, the spray nozzle began to not extend. Now - 6 months after installation - the retractable nozzle will not extend at all on its own. If I want it to work, I have to manually extend it (ewww) which I am not willing to do.Although I loved it while it worked, it broke far too fast. I didn't expect it to work forever, but under 6 months is a bit insane.If you're in the market for a bidet, look for another brand that'll last because this one won't.

Installation is not as easy as one might expect for this product. The control valve setting give you either a trickle of water or Old Faithful. And there is no temperature control so the water is ice cold. Not a great feeling if you live in a cold climate.

It was perfect and really helpful for my elderly parents. Definitely recommend this product.

I have seen the light! I will never do a number 2 without a bidet again. This bidet has a fully customizable pressure nozzle that will either gentle spritz a lovely stream at your grassy knoll and gassy hole or you can turn it up on high for a blast that will pressure wash off the most stubborn streaks. The water is cold. Great for the summer when you have swamp a$$ but in the winter...yowza. Still worth it. Amazing product. If you're on the fence about getting one, don't be. Buy it now!

I did not used the product!

The bidet worked fine, however the T adapter caused water leak when we were away from home and resulted in damage that costed $7K to repair. I see several other buyers reported this issue. I wish the manufacturer did more quality testing to avoid this situation for the buyers.

Was very surprised by how good it works.

Super easy to install! Variety of settings for front and back low and high pressure. Nothing to change the temperature on it because we didn't order that one. Great product!!

It was my first time installing as well using bidet. My experience so far has been a pleasant one. Super easy install and the bidet itself is a welcome lifestyle change. I'm appreciative of it as well as my wife and daughter. Solid buy.

Bought as a gift...yes a gift for my adult son. For his bathroom. He loves it. Yes the water is cool but it gets the JOB done. He's impressed. His wife doesn't care for the cool butt shower.His 7 year old son has taken to using Dad's bathroom bc of the bidet.You can adjust water pressure/spray. Sure you can spend hundreds and get more features but for the price this gets the job done. Easy to install. Only suggestion he made is to purchase the spacers since installing  the bidet the toilet seat fit is a little off. Not sure of it's quality only had it a month but should it not last my son will upgrade. He can't believe we, Americans, don't have these in every bathroom. Ordering myself one....now.

Purchased during the great toilet paper shortage of 2020. I was told this device would help cut down on my toilet paper consumption, which it did. My problem has always been making sure I am clean after doing my business. This inexpensive bidet has solved that problem. My home has well water and it is cold I could have installed a mixing valve but i am a miser so the shot of water can be quite cold. However with that being said when I travel to relatives or on business, Man I miss that device! I am not a mechanical wiz however if you take your time you can install it in under an hour.

The model I got doesn't have temperature control. However, everything else about it is good. It doesn't leak which is the main thing.

Nice addition to our bathroom.  It works perfectly.  Both my husband and I use it.  It was super easy to install.  Ours is only hooked up to our cold water line, but we live in the south and  our cold water isn't that cold, so works for us just fine.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in a little more cleanliness.

Ordered two, had a handyman install them, and in both cases, the T-Valve and bidet hoses leaked profusely. I have two replacements in the way. If those leak as well, I'm calling it quits with this product.

Nice way to clean up the back door

I actually am not impressed. I'm a seasoned bidet user. Our old one cracked and was leaking. Bought this and it's just not cleaning as well. I will be ordering the original bidet attachment we had before.

I would not buy this garbage.  Broke after two months.  Followed directions to troubleshoot and still does not work.  Garbage.  Dont waste your time and money!!

Once you start useing it nothing else will cleang you better

as an older man with torn rotator cuff injuries i figured this would help me out' it's maybe the single best purchase if my life other than my motorcycle. I can't believe these things aren't in every house, they are the absolute best.

Review for Neo 120.  Bought 1 and will purchase more. Great upgrade for the toilet. Easy to install.

The French have given much to work culture; fine food and wine, art and literature, a persistent quest for freedom- but the bidet is the one that I'm thankful for the most! I learned early that 'Cleanliness is next to Godliness' and with the Luxe  bidet you can come as close as possible to achieving that ideal insofar as your lower alimentary canal is concerned. I can't imagine living without this thing! And they're inexpensive!! I have 3 installed, one on every toilet. Get one or more, it's easy to install in about 30 minutes, and you'll be a very happy (and clean!) person.

I received this bidet today, tried to install, super simple, but it's leaking. I called customer service & they are sending out 2 new t connectors to see if that helps. Ill update.

Will never go back to barbaric toilet paper again!

I actually got this because we talked about getting one for the RV to cut down on toilet paper. I figured I'd try it out in the house before I go cutting tubing in the camper. OH MY! I like this more every time I use it. Installation wasn't bad, actually pretty straightforward. I worried about aim, but this thing hits the bullseye every time. It took me a few tries to get it to cover the entire AO (area of operations for you civilians) but it's not that hard to figure out. Really good buy so far.

Easy to install. Just need a screwdriver to unscrew the toilet seat. It took me hardly 5 minutes to install.

I mean, I'll say the same thing that every bedet owner says.... yes, this is nice. you're gonna have to adjust it right, cause solid steam, make it hit where it needs to.... but I do have an issue. maybe I got a broken unit, or maybe it's too do with my apartment's water.... but the pressure control does literally nothing. it's on or off-there is zero difference if you're play with the pressure control. I assume it's my system, but if this isn't, then woulda been better of work just an on off switch... because that's literally all the pressure control is to me.but I'm done complaining. overall, I love it so much. it is.... nice.

The last time I get this in that area was when I was an alter boy with my priest

Better than hoped for

One you go bidet you never go back!

For comfort

This was our second bidet, and it does not work well.  The bidet in our other bathroom shoots and fine and precise stream, but this bidet does not.  It shoots a wide stream that goes all over.  I've tried making sure the Cleaning door is close, but that is not the problem.  I would have sent this back, but I waited too long to install it, and exceeded the 30 days before I became aware of the problem.  Don't buy it.  Some of these bidet attachments work well, but I wouldn't use this brand.

Highly recommend it. I can't live without this piece. I bought three of them for my house and I bought one extra for my friend as a gift. It is life changer and everyone is happy. Easy to assemble. I couldn't wait for my husband to install it for me so I installed by my self.

Had to test when first installed. Water supply on,, no leaks. Now for the cold real test for the first time. Tried to get my wife to go first, but she said NO. So I sat down and turned on the device,,,, oh boy, what a thrill. from this moment on I will use it all the time. It works real good.

I bought one in blue 8 years ago and this one was as good but even cheaper. Easy to install and needed no Teflon tape to install.  Great pressure and accurate [placement of the nozzle.  5 Stars. *****

Love this product. My life is so easy after installing this . Thank you so much

While used only a few times, I just ordered a second; best purchase ever made. In time, the savings alone on TP will pay for these.  If it weren't for the YouTube video, I would have never known about this. If it lasts as long as I hope, then this product needs more promotion/praise. The number of trees and wasted water to make one roll, will convince most to buy one or two of these Kool-E cleaners. LOL.  For the disabled, obese, elderly, handicapped and those with other problems, this is the answer!

I bought mine used from Amazon Warehouse which was missing 1/2 mounting pucks that allows the bidet to have even tension. So I had to use super glue and cut a massive rubber grommet to compensate but it works great now (Didn't feel like waiting a week to send back)I also didn't have any of the included tape to prevent leaks however after 2 days I haven't seen a single drop at all so no complaints there.This unit also only has 4 states: Bidet on/off and self clean on/off. I can't discern any change in pressure when moving the knob which is also fine because the default pressure is very good!The actual cleaning feature of the bidet works wonders, your keister is gonna be cleaner than your countertops with this product.

I wanted a bidetFor a while, I did some research.. and my boyfriend had this brand . So it's good buy

Really easy to install

The plastic nozzle guard dropped in the toilet and got flushed at some point. Got stuck in the actual toilet and clogged it partially. Because it is a rectangle it got lodged deep inside and not even a plumber could get it out with the toilet removed. So I had to buy a new toilet. Thanks a lot. What genius designs a plastic piece that comes off and falls into the toilet? Just get a better one.

I received this product from a friend as a gift and finally managed to get the (relatively new) bolts loose on the existing toilet seat: the installation was very quick and easy. My wife and I were a bit flummoxed by the concept so we did some humorous research on these internets and then put it through its (our?) paces.It was sensational, to say the least. The lightest pressure setting was quite strong! This may change over time but we are happily enjoying the considerable benefits (as well as the need for LESS paper in our septic).If you're on the fence about buying one, just do it!

I bought 3 bidets and 1 is already leaking where the controls are. I don't know if this is an isolated issue or just cheap material used. I am giving it the benefit and leaning towards the former (for now). I already requested a replacement and hopefully the other 2 will remain good for at least a couple of years.

This product installs the way that most of products of this ilk are installed. However, the softness and focus of the water flow on the bottom is much worse than others that I have purchased.

This thing is great I never felt so fresh. It's a good feeling.

This was so easy to install, the best value I have seen for a bidet! It is quite cold but I didn't mind not having the temp adjustment. I installed it so quickly and everyone in the house loves it! Works really well no issues so far

Not heated but that's fine in an area where you might not need it (e.g. where it doesn't get to freezing temperatures). As others have mentioned, if you put on high and at the right angle it will give you an enema, which is a bad thing if you're not expecting it or a maybe good thing if you consented.4/5 stars because 1) the door prevents the sprayer from lowering on our device, which means we have to adjust the door to be slightly open so the sprayer can lower. And 2) there's really no 'low power' spray mode, it's either extreme or more extreme... which I'm fine with, but my partner would like something a bit softer.

Great product and cost.

Love this bidet!! Excellent price! Easy to install! Use it every day.

I purchased this product (LUXE Bidet NEO 120) in November 2020 and installed immediately. It has been a trusty source of hygiene on a nearly daily basis (whenever I am home about 330 days a year). Today, after approximately 28 months, the nozzle controlling the pressure fell off after regular use but rendering the bidet worthless and unusable. Unfortunately I did not register for the extended two year warranty, and the product worked about four months past the expiration of that warranty anyway.  I would still recommend this product.

Easy to install, to use and it leaves you clean.

????????????

Very comfortable.

Super easy to install works great with adjustable pressure 10 outta 10 would recommend

Keeps my bottom end clean, easy to install and better than the tushy units

Nothing to dislike. 5 minute install and everything works excellent. Nice that it has the clean feature.

They back it up if something goes wrong with it.

Great one. Without this item, we can not go toilet:)

A little annoyed we bought it and it won't fit our round lid m toilet.  Hits the back of the seat so it can't go down.  Will be returning.

This item works well if you install it properly. It's important to have the base of the seat line up within the supplied plastic circles, otherwise it may pinch the water lines when you're sitting on it.

Installation was very easy! I also bought the shutoff valve from Luxe (ordered on their website from the enclosed paperwork that came with the item) and it helped slow the amount of water coming out of the Bidet nozzle. I liked it so much I bought a 2nd one to install at my girlfriends place, so she could enjoy it, too!

Stopped working properly pretty soon after purchase :( sometimes just doesn't turn on. Don't know why

It's a personal pressure washer for your donut hole. Perfect for those spicy dumps after over indulging in fine Mexican cuisine. A little twist of the nozzle and a refreshing super jet of cold water goes straight to your sphincter. 10/10 would recommend.I ordered this with low expectations but this is pretty alright. Make sure you get the seat levelers or it'll be off slightly. Easy to install and no leaks since initial install. Worth every penny.

First off this was just heaven sent.  the pressure nozzle works great and already starts at a pretty good kick. When I first used it I tested it out pretty high and ended up with a mouthful of water so be careful.

Very easy to install, about 5 minutes. I only use it in the first 2 settings because it has a lot of power.

The water stream works great but if you ever try to wipe the nozzle door, look out! This is the second one I bought and on both the door has broken on the hinged side. If lightly wiping with a Clorox wipe breaks it, that in my opinion is junk. I won't buy another one, will spend a little more to get a better product.

I installed this myself in about 15 mins. and have been using it for over a month without any problems. It easy to install and easy to use. I would definitely recommend this and have told everyone I know that they need to get one.. It's a game changer.

Four settings for your hygienic pleasure: Low, Medium, High, and the Shocker!Y'all ain't never going back to straight paper after this.

the pressure is a bit high. i am not sure if this is because of the bidet or if its because of my houses water pressure but once you get used to it you are left with a clean feeling.

It was a basic  bidet. Cool water nothing fancy. I did like it. After a few days I had some plumbing issues. Water leaking. I had to remove the bidet.

easy install for DIY customers.  clean and comfortable.

I absolutely loved this until the clean nozzle function quit five days after the return window closed. Bummer!

I can't use the bathroom without one of these installed, life changing. This product has various settings for the water pressure and it's great, as well as a self cleaning setting, pretty easy to install and easy to use! It does have a powerful water pressure, and can sometimes be too much.

Works good when it works. Less than a year later the nozzle thing that pops down has stopped doing so and stays hidden up behind the door thing. Wouldn't recommend.

The pressure that it takes to activate the nozzle is uncomfortably high, it is definitely a good idea to get a product like this, maybe not this one.

A friend recommended this product.  Super easy to install.  Literally anyone can do it.  Works great.  I regret not getting this sooner.

Very nice and easy to install.

Good quality and useable

It was completely worthless since the water was dribbling out at the highest setting.  My home water pressure is 50psi so I knew that there was something amiss.  I removed the flow restrictor at the water inlet. It was a night and day difference, which made the bidet functional.  Just pull out the parts shown, but leave the seal for the hose connection.

If you buy this item just know that when you put the seat on top of this it won't close down In the front. Mine was up so high when I tried to close it that it would have broke something if I actually sat on it.  They do sell some kind of bumper attachment that you stick on the bottom front of the seat. I probably had to much space to do that, so Im just sending it back. They also say you can find some other kind of toilet seat that might solve this problem. I was hopeful for this product to work, but it's a case of get the real thing to do it right.

Never had one before but absolutely happy we ordered it

4 YEARS GOING STRONG. STILL CLEANING LIKE DAY ONE.

It looks great but as previously stated it raises the commode seat up at least 4 in to where it does not sit flush. Therefore I returned mines with no issues from the seller

We added this bidet to the guest bath. Based on reports from our daughter, who stays with us, it's a great product.

Installation is easy but you must make sure to buy toilet seat bumpers if you need them. I bought them from them but those bumpers were useless because my elongated toilet seat has built-in bumpers which have more than 1/2 inch clearance from the toilet. Before buying this bidet, I was worried about the water connection and the knobs being plastic, but the water connection is not plastic anymore(see picture) but unfortunately the knobs are still cheap plastic that can break easily if you're not gently using them. As other customers already said, the water jet is not wide but powerful which is good for people with small/narrow rear and save water but it's not good for large bodies like me. I have to move left-right to get the water clean every part and that wastes more water and also toilet paper because it takes more paper to dry.Good for: anyone with slim body, anyone trying to save moneyWhat could improve: Make the knobs metal, make the snozzle rotate left/right with a wider water jet, lower the lowest pressure because it's too high from start.

I've never had or used a bidet before, so I was a bit skeptical. Installation was simple and all the appropriate hoses and fittings seem well made. Before I used it, I turned the wash knob just to see what to expect. After drying the water off the wall opposite the toilet, I began having second thoughts, this thing sprayed water all the across my bathroom! Finally, the moment of truth came, and I was going to use it. First, I'm not sure why there is multiple pressure settings, the lowest one got me spotlessly clean. The nozzles are definitely right on target, too. I'm beginning to doubt I will ever use toilet paper again!

I love this bidet.  It's a needed comfort and convenience. It's very simple to install and re-install with the tools provided in package. There's no temperature control because it links straight to the plumbing. And yet, that doesn't matter to me, because it doesn't use electricity, and it's sturdier than the whole seat replacement bidets I've used. You might need to use some fillers to prevent the seat from wobbling.

We purchased these for three toilets to save on toilet paper and to be hygenically cleaner!Very easy to install. I installed all three in less than an hour. Make sure you register to get an extended Warranty. I did not hook them up to warm water and they are made out of a durable plasic and are not soft.Joe B

Shipped on time and had all parts and it was easy to install..works great getting one for every toilet

No Media

This is my third one and Absolutely LOVE ?? this product. Easy to install and Easy to use.

Excellent replaces the one that valve broke after 5 years - excellent for a non electric bidet unit - my din hooked up the unit with upgraded water hoses and 3-way valves

Installed in less than 10 minutes. Does a great job of spraying poop out of my butt.

Easy to install and use.  Love it

It's been almost 3 years of using and one of the knob got broken. I asked them about purchasing a knob and they sent it for free. I was thinking about to buy a new bidet but it works perfectly fine.

I've bought hundreds of items on Amazon and this is definitely the best product I've purchased throughout the years.  I have it installed in all of my bathrooms.  I have bought many for friends and family members as Christmas and housewarming gifts.  During the pandemic when TP was scarce this was a life saver.  You only need enough TP for a quick check and to dry yourself after using the bidet.  My family now uses 1/4 or maybe even less toilet paper and we feel cleaner than we've ever felt.  Absolutely no need for baby wipes which have clogged my toilets in the past.  Only problem you'll find is that you won't want to poop anywhere besides home.

Came with everything needed to install, extremely user friendly instructions, beautiful packaging, so easy to install, and it works wonderfully. There is no temperature control but it's really not that bad. I will install on all my toilets!

Had a temporary plumbing disaster , had to stop flushing toilet paper I know TMI , thought I would only use until pipe was replaced, works so well it's a keeper you do get used to cold water rinse it's not that bad

this is my second one I have owned of this exact model.  this goes under your current seat.  temperature is whatever it comes out of your pipes on cold.  this can be way too cold in the winter and a bit warm in the summer depending on your pipes in the house.  first one still works but it's in another house.overall simple design with very few issues.  on occasion the cleaning cover has not opened when it should and I think that is just the seat pressing down to the point it causes some friction when it tries to open.  I would recommend this to anyone that wants a simple setup without a lot of cost or bells and whistles.

If your in the US and want to put this in an rv, you should check the thread size of the toilet fill valve and water supply line in your travel trailer.  This bidet comes with residential 3 way fitting for fill valve.  No plumbing stores will carry the 3way fitting for the rv fill valve.  However the bidet manufacturer has them on their website for about $10.

So easy to install 5 min I got basic model but would get the hot water attachment one in my water is a real wake up call :) thing is amazing though!!

Love this product, works great, price is right & love the cleanliness it gives a person. Would recommend & have.

Lack of tissue paper use

cold water but does its job very well

It hasn't been quite a year yet I brought this March 12 2022 and it February 2023 and it sprung a small leak. I kept noticing water on the floor and thought it was from the kids splashing water from the sink. The leak wasn't from the base at the toilet that remained tight but the connection to the unit itself started leaking. I give it three stars I expected it to last longer than 11 months.

Dies tremendius job after potty.

I purchased this bidet to replace the Bio bidet that needed to leave our potty. The problem with the old bidet was the spray nozzles just never get clean, even after we clean them on a weekly basis.I don't know if it's hard water or mold, but it looked really bad.  I thought we would try and upgrade to this Luxe bidet because it has a spray nozzle box that the nozzles hide behind and some type of self cleaning adjustment. I have not been able to get the self cleaning procedure to work yet but will look into that later. The water pressure on the bidet spray is very light, even when adjusting it from low to high. It always seems low. I will say I thought the installation was going to be easier since I was replacing my bidet with another bidet. But surprisingly it was not that easy. None of the fittings and hoses that came with the new bidet were the same. So I had to take all the old hoses and fittings off the toilet from the old bidet and start from scratch with the new bidet. Nothing was hard about the installation other than where our toilet is located in a tight fitting potty room.

I was happy to see that all the components needed to install were included along with tools and tape.

Such a good product for a reasonable price! You should definitely try it.

We just bought our second NEO bidet after trying two others. Ours does not heat the water, but we are used to the cold water in bidets. Had a plumber install it, but was very straightforward. We've had our other one for almost 3 years with no problems.  I would definitely recommend this.

I would have gotten this years ago had I known how awesome it is!!!! Game-freaking-changer! I love it! My seat is a little wobbly- I don't care!

Easy install, and does a good job for it's intended purpose.

I love my bidet. It is wonderful. I do not have the temperature control one so the water is cold but that is okay. Had I known that a bidet was this great, I would have gotten one a long time ago. Plus I love that when I change toilets I can just move my bidet onto the next one. Also, it was so very easy to install.

This thing does what it says it does. I spend a lot less money on toilet tissue since we got it. Especially these days it paid for itself probably within a month. Takes a little getting used to but I'll never go back. Get one!

I never thought I'd be leaving a review for a bidet for the world to see, but here we are.This is the 4th one of these that I've purchased.  I have two at home and I've installed two more for family members.I initially bought one during the Great Toilet Paper Famine of 2020, when it seems that TP was as scarce and valuable as Bitcoin.  My initial choice was based on the affordability, availability, and overall good reviews.There are certainly fancier bidets out there that will heat the water, and I briefly entertained the notion before I realized that I'd have to run a new outlet for one.  I was skeptical that the cold water would be, shall we say, unpleasant, but for the price I decided to try it.I'm glad I did.  Installation was very straightforward, though I did have to get a new feed line to the toilet tank as the old one was too long.  This was easy and only cost a few bucks at the local orange home improvement store.  The hardest part was dealing with residual water in the toilet tank, which I just caught in a small bucket under the tank inlet.  Not difficult but easy to make a mess by accident.The water pressure of the stream is easy to control, and thank goodness because this thing is capable of an UNGODLY jet of water.  I managed to shoot a stream 15 feet away and hit the wall on the opposite end of the bathroom when I accidentally bumped the spray valve.  Imagine that kind of pressure on your caboose and you'll appreciate the fine control of the valve.Even in the winter, the cold water is not uncomfortable.  No idea why-- it should be one hell of a wake up call the minute it hits you-- but it's fine.  It's also neater, cheaper and more hygienic than toilet paper.  It cuts down on paper waste and decreases the chances of clogging a waste pipe, and it's unobtrusive even when scrubbing the toilet.I've had one for about 2 years now and there have been no leaks and no problems of any kind.  My skepticism is gone, to the point that I recommend this to anyone that is looking for an in-toilet bidet.

This works very well as a bidet but it started leaking after a few months, so now whenever I turn it on the housing with the controls starts leaking water.

The bidet works great. The pressure dial is very sensitive so it took a few times to figure out how to keep it from spraying too hard. If you do not get one with temperature control be ready because the water is very cold. Overall I think it is a pretty good product but I should have purchased one with a temperature control.

I got this product where it was working just fine. Only issue I have is the cold water, can't really control that, but also it stopped working. The nossle stops half way and then shoots into itself and doesn't clean me. So after a month you can say it.... Crapped out on me

The product was purchased for my husband who had surgery I felt like this would be a prefect gift for him to use in his bathroom.  Turns out he is over joyed now that I have his response I will be purchasing one for my bathroom.  I wish I had thought of this earlier for my Mom who was disabled.  I definitely would recommend this product for elderly and disabled individuals who require assistance using the facilities.

Wow I am so happy!! This is life changing! Been wanting one for a while. A little surprising when I first used it but we are all good now

I was so pleasantly surprised how nice this is. For the price , it can't be beat. Well made. Easy to install. Refreshing and you feel so much clearer. Well worth it.

Useful as usual!

Works wellGood priceThey sent me the wrong colorMy chocolate hole stays clean

I just bought the second one of this after using the first one for 2 years. Its easy to install as it comes with all the tools needed for installation and also very easy to use. The design also accents the bathroom.

This device is plastic and won't last long in a large household. It's very easy to install and no leakage whatsoever but again, it won't last with multiple people using it during the day.It comes with plastic wrenches but mine wouldn't fit.  I would buy it again

Had a year now, my first. Will never be without one again. May go with the hot water hook up next time. But really not bad as I figured for only cold water.

This has to be one of the greatest things I have purchased.  Easy to install and very easy to use.

Cold water, cold seat -- not a pleasant experience.  Get an electric one because warm water and a warm seat is so much better.

Easy installation, I like that brings everything you need. You may need to get the seat bumpers to level it up, (see pics) otherwise it may not function well. It comes with only the cold water, I live in Pennsylvania, and is not an issue. Also, this model is only for the back, sorry! No feminine setting.  It does a great job cleaning you up! I can't believe that I was missing such a clean feeling. Get it !

Purchased this for my fiance since he's having shoulder surgery, I figured it would help him when he used the bathroom. I installed it by myself (so stinkin simple!!). You definitely need to make sure your toilet seat has higher "legs" to hold it up from the toilet bowl considering the bidet attachment raises the back of the seat a good, 1/2 inch....if you don't have that extra clearance, the water will not hit the "target" area.....you'll have to raise yourself up (laughter WILL ensue)....once I fixed that issue, he finds it quite nice to be able to feel cleaner. I don't understand WHY more of us don't use these in the US! It is MUCH better than the method we use!!! I will purchase another for sure! This price is great! (I may get the one that oscillates just to try out something different.) If you are looking for something to try out or to help out a loved one, this is definitely worth the money!

For several years I have been seeing a doctor for post cancer anal surgery, I would get a itchy bottom to the point it was embarrassing.  I was proscribe several different medications with none of them working.  I decided to try a different method.  a toilet bidet, knowing I couldn't afford a new toilet with the built in bidet I opted to thy this.  Wow what a difference this made.  My itching went from a 10 to 1 or 2.  Not to mention we haven't bought toilet paper since we installed this.Very easy to install, less than 5 minutes.  My husband even likes it.  After you install it be prepared to adjust it on the toilet until you get it just right, than it stays in place.  So far have no issues with it.

Think about it... Dip your fingers in peanut butter and then clean it with just a couple sheets of toilet paper. Wouldn't you want to wash your fingers with water? Why not the exit port too?

All the required tools are included in the box. Installation was easy and it works well. Highly recommend!  Pro tip: before you start the install, wash the toilet, shut off the supply valve and flush toilet. Lay down a towel to catch any drips. You may want to use some pliers to hold the braided hose in place while you tighten the nuts. This will help prevent the hose from twisting up.

This is a fine bidet - it works as intended. However, I've found the pressure control doesn't really function. The first level is soft, but once you get mid-way, there stops being a difference.

Best purchase made, no complaints loving it.

This is my second purchase, installed in my father's second toilet.  The install is pretty seamless once you get all your tools ready.  Most of which are included in the box.  The only glitch is that your exhisting seat bolts may not be long enough to accomodate the bidet as well.  So you'll just gt the store (bring the old ones with you), get longer ones, and get the bumpers too while your at it, as you may then have a wide enough gap to impede functionality.  Once it's all done, it's all halleluja again!!  Just buy this. I didnt need all the bells n whistles.

I've had other brands that don't work as well and cost more. This one is really a great buy because it doesn't cost a whole lot. This one sprays well and the adjustable spray is very nice. It also has an adjustment for smaller or bigger people. Meaning it sprays more forward or farther back great buy!

I love it.  I would buy it again and would recommend it to others.

I walk with a lovely scent and now wisle when i walk

As another reviewer said 'i didn't know i needed it until i used it'. Fantastic and easy to install. You will not be disappointed.

If this was used that's pretty gross... but really? A Crack fixed with glue and it coming yellow and broken like this? Very disappointed. I'm going to return and see if I can get one that is not messed up like this, and then I'll review again.

Knob broke after two years of purchase. Cheap plastic knob has been used on this product. And, I can't find the parts for knob replacement. The whole piece need to be replaced. What a waste of money.

Do you enjoy feeling clean after doing your business and knowing you have the cleanest rear-end out of all your friends? If so, this is the product for you. Go gentle at first if it's your first time.

easy to use. set up u must use plumbers tape to stop leaks. expected for the price of the bidet.

Absolutely the best thing I ever purchased for myself it saves on toilet paper and you feel so clean just like you got out of the shower!! I highly recommend it to everyone!!

buyer beware: i've had this bidet for a couple months now and I have enjoyed using the products and it works well, however, one day I saw that the nozzle spray cover had disappeared and I noticed a weakness in my toilets flush. $500 for a plumber and plumbing products later and we managed to recover the shield piece. I like the product but I wish it held together just a little bit better to prevent the situation from occurring.

The knobs break over time. Cheap plastic. Ordered heavy duty replacements that don't quite fit and now I can't find the correct ones.

I save so much money on toilet paper, it's seamlessly cleans and leaves me feeling like nothing else is as good!

I've thought about getting a bidet for years and finally pulled the trigger on this one.Game changer.  I don't know how I've gone so long without this, but it is glorious and easy to install.  I'm considering getting one for another bathroom as well.

I've had this bidet for about 3 yrs now and as long as you are careful with the pressure, it's works amazing.  I've saved a ton of money on toilet paper since making this purchase,  although you probably use more water, but well worth it regardless.I purchased seat spacers and a pee guard since the gap between the seat and toilet was larger than expected, and with those items installed it works perfectly without spraying all over the bathroom.Definitely a great purchase.

Bought this after my doctor recommended I purchase a bidet for my hemorrhoid problems. It's easy to attach to the toilet and it works as stated. Very satisfied with this purchase!

i would buy again

This is a great product,easy to install great installation instructions and all the parts needed to install!

No exaggeration: My husband has installed eleven bidets and by far the Luxe Bidets are the best. Best quality, best instructions, best water flow, best comfort and spray. Our family is sold on this product and if you talk to us for any length of time, we will tell you all about it. I feel bad for our family and friends-- we are constantly raving about bidet attachments and Luxe is superior to every other brand.

This is so amazing!

It's so nice. I wasn't really sure what to expect when I got it, but now I can't imagine a life without it. I recommend to everyone. Leaves me feeling clean and fresh without a shower!The cool water is nice after spicy food, and I haven't felt the need for any warm water at all. I can shift around and as a lady I can clean all the bits.Install was easy. Just turn off the water, drain the tank, take off your seat, screw in all the parts and reassemble, turn on the water and boom. You're done. I've never ever ever done anything remotely like this and I did it. You can too!To test, put plastic cling across the seat and see the stream work! Voila! Best purchase of my life, hands down. 30$ down for hundreds of dollars saved in tp!

No more dealing with ??.Now if I have to go somewhere else, i feel like I'm back in the stone age using paper ??.It was simple to install, did require a bit of targeting to get it just right.Since then it's been doing it's thing and I recommend everyone getting one.

Another user suggestions an online ball valve which I added to regulate the bidet's flow rate but even with that it is crazy strong. They of course sell their own flow regulator for this.Also don't put stickers in place that need to be removed when using but the stickers don't come off perfectly.Nice and cold :) but the sink is in front of the toilet so no easy way to efficiently get hot water without wasting a lot. Also the wrenches they gave don't do much for plastic fittings.

We love this product, bought two more for our vacation home.

I like it a lot

Very easy to install.  works great.  I'm adding a 2nd unit.

It seems nice but I couldn't put it on without at least one fixture leaking.  I had to send it back.  I watched a YouTube.  Called the company and they sent me a plastic fixture that would stop the leak.  I just couldn't do it.  Very disappointed.

Welcome to the 21st century.Works very well for us.Easy install.Now guilt free.A lot of that soft TP comes from the boreal forests of northern Ontario Canada.Been there - it's a wasteland for your bum.

gap between seat

We like this product. Easy to install and easy to use.Little careful first-time use. Cold water not an issue.Nice force but you need tissue after use this.It's saving my Wipes usage.  For kids not recommended.I ordered 2 items. I received it different packaging, one is old version(probably used, some water marked and package also not standard, it zipper bag) another one new. I just return old version.One thing after I brought it reduce price little bit.Overall as product good. Recommended.

My husband installed it in 10 minutes. We did not get the temperature controlled model, but it's fine!

It's a great product for the money, once you use one of these, you won't know how you lived without it.

Amazing! Never felt so clean lol. Must have for every toilet in the house.

Love it. Leaves you nice and clean. Especially because the nozzle cleaner knob moves the stream.  Have saved so much on toilet paper.

My co-worker was talking about this item so I decided to try it out.  I easily installed it and use it everyday after I do my business.  Sometimes you have to angle the water nozzle but for the most part it cleans the hole when you use it.  Very refreshing feeling after a bowl movement to clean yourself.  Love it.

This product has been a major change in my personal hygiene. I do have a problem. The knobs are cheap plastic and one broke. I am going to have to roll the dice to get a replacement online since hardware stores do not carry them.

My mother has rectal cancer and this is exactly what we needed after radiation!

Does what it's supposed to.  Very happy with my purchase.  It's been installed for over a month.  Wanting to get another for the other bathroom in house.When I'm away from my home and have to go, I miss it!!  If your thinking of purchasing, get off the pot and buy it.  Haha

This is my first time using a bidet. I installed it a couple of days ago and it is working great so far. It was easy to install and is effective.

If your water line to your toilet is a rigid pipe, go get a flexible hose (for toilets) before you even start installation. I had a rigid pipe and I had gone to the hardware store for something else before I started installing, only to have to go right back to the store.I was a little hesitant about this because it's cold water. However, the water isn't as cold as you might think. It's a comfortable temperature. Bidet works great! Like the thousands of other buyers, I recommend and would buy again.

I love the rose gold and it works  great.

I can't believe I waited this long to get one.  So many wasted years of my life, all the hardships.  Until now.

This brand is not built to last and within two years became unusable. Thought i had to replace just the t adapter part but in reality the whole thing started leaking instead. Buy elsewhere.

Much Needed!

Easy install. Amazing clean feel

First of all, the customer service is awsome. secoend, the product is easy to install and is great.

Using a toilet without a bidet is now a problem. This thing makes life so much better and works great.

I've purchased similar versions of this with no issue.  The sprayer on this particular unit did not function properly and I had to return it.  This unit only has a rear spray nozzle (no feminine/forward sprayer).

I never felt the same after using this, going to the public restrooms feel so outdated. My wife love it so much!

It's a No for me, for women it's a bit more difficult to clean up in the front Without making a mess with the water on the floor

Great investment. Easy to instal and the best personal hygiene item I ever had. You would not regret this purchase.

I rexiently had back surgery and I was not able to bend. This product was very easy to install and to use. It was a little strange at first but it works like a charm once you get the aim and the pressure the way you want it. It was a life saver

Excellent product, clear and well illustrated instructions, fit perfectly, even on a 1973 unit.

I believe this bidet is overrated. The pressure is overwhelming. It is almost impossible to regulate.  One on the dial barely reaches the bum and two on the dial is so strong it feels like an enema! We attempted to regulate the water pressure from the tank hose.  Even when we regulated the water by this method the blast was still to strong to clean well.  Further, there is no front cleaning mode.  The tilt and aim of the cleaner does not allow for comfortable seating on the toilet seat with or without a potty stool.I gave it two stars because it does expel water for cleaning and it does self clean when cued.  However, I have another bidet that works like a charm, it was not as expensive and it has a front and back cleaning mechanism.This bidet is a no for me.

Came without proper parts ..It had  European part we had to go to parts store 4 parts

Been looking for a bidet for so long. This one is just perfect, so easy to install.

I like the look and design, but material with it was made, it's poor quality and fragile.

Love it

Simple gadget, my brother installed it in 15 minutes, no problem, and very satisfied especially with the affordable price.

This is probably one of the best things I've ever purchased from Amazon. It's convenient and easy to install. It's practical and pays for itself. Having a bidet helps you stay more sanitary and clean. It saves time and money. The only negative is that when you use the restroom elsewhere, you'll miss having your bidet!

My wife loves it...worth the money.

Bought 2 of these Luxe Neo 120 Bidet attachments after doing much research on bidet attachments for the toilet.  At 65, I am not as flexible as I once was.  The clean feeling that this gives after a trip to the bathroom, cannot be understated.  I am in a cold climate, and the use of a cold-only water spray is not an issue.  A little surprising the first time, but not uncomfortable.  Many such bidet attachment brands receive complaints that the water pressure is weak.  NOT SO, WITH THIS BRAND!  The pressure/water flow is adjustable, but you will likely not need higher than the first or second setting, unless you have low water pressure going to your bathroom toilet.  Conversely, if you find the pressure too high on the lowest setting, just partially close the water valve coming from the wall, that all toilets really should have if installed properly.  I particularly like that the nozzle is always behind a removeable (for more thorough cleaning) splash door, dropping down into position only when activated, and there is a nob that diverts water to clean the nozzle itself after each use.  Easy instillation if you follow the directions (about 15 - 20 min.) Anyone experiencing leaks just didn't follow directions.  I did need to purchase a few inexpensive items to make the fit perfect.  Be aware that the current connection between the wall water shut-off valve and the tank needs to be a metallic flex hose, rather than a rigid metal hose.  This is discovered as you read the directions.  (Be aware the product manual is available for download in the product description before you purchase) You may need longer toilet seat screws that will accommodate the additional height of the bidet attachment at the hinge area.  You will likely need toilet seat bumpers for the underside of the seat, as the bidet attachment raises the seat slightly at the back.  If the seat is not level when you sit, it could, in theory, crack.  A quick trip to the hardware section of the store or ordering online solves these inexpensive issues.  Can't believe I lived this long without a bidet, and am very pleased with this model and its price!

This thing is fantastic! It really gets you clean and cuts way down on toilet paper.  I was concerned about how cold the water would be, however because it's in the house the water is isn't really cold. I highly recommend this product

You cannot beat the price of this bidet, in general they have gone down a lot. Save yourself time and money and search no more. You don't need all the bells and whistles when it comes to bidets. We have two and both are without warm water. Sure it's cold on the bits but you're not on there long enough to really care. The instal is maybe 15mins and easy for one person to do solo. We've really noticed a reduction in toilet paper use and thankfully during COVID we had our original.

Absolutely garbage. Water comes but it is impossible to use it. I am not able to give detailed explanation because of privacy but hopefully people will understand what i mean. Water does not reachs you. Waste of.momey and water. Beware.

Yes the first blast is quite surprising but oh man does it do the trick. Such a great item when toilet paper was tough to get. Easy to install with basic plumbing knowledge. Get the warm water version if you're boujee

Awesome product

I recently purchased the UXE Bidet NEO 120 and it has been a game-changer for my bathroom experience. The self-cleaning nozzle and fresh water supply make this bidet attachment incredibly convenient and hygienic to use.The installation was very straightforward and the instructions were clear and easy to follow. The attachment fits snugly onto my toilet seat and has not leaked or come loose since I installed it.The adjustable water pressure and temperature controls make it easy to find the perfect setting for my needs, and the self-cleaning nozzle is a great touch that provides an extra level of cleanliness.I have noticed a significant improvement in my personal hygiene since I started using the UXE Bidet NEO 120, and I have also noticed a reduction in the amount of toilet paper I use.Overall, I would highly recommend the UXE Bidet NEO 120 to anyone looking for a high-quality, convenient, and hygienic bidet attachment. It has transformed my bathroom experience and I am incredibly happy with my purchase.

It's the easiest bidet I install since we started using bidet in our home.????????????

If you want a freezing cold colonoscopy, or to have the walls of your bathroom rinsed, this is your product.

Our son talked us into this'I didn't know they existed to add-on. Easy to install'we started with one and now bought one for every bath in the house'and just installed one for my mom! I sent another brand back and stuck with this one. We love these things!

It did not fit on my Durant toilet.  The seat would not close properly.  Unfortunately it took me awhile to get someone to try to install it, and then when he did, it did not fit.

this is great LOVE IT

Really love this product. I like the lever optioned one better than the dial but it's still great

Installed and wanted to try out, obviously, but it didn't work due to the way my toilet seat curves on inside.It comes with a laundry list of problems in their guide and troubleshooting tips but what company should do is warn that a curved toilet seat may not work.And the fact that it has problems listed and solution is to buy more products from them is also frustrating.I guess I'll try and get a new toilet seat (even though the one I have is new)

This is my second one. Very easy to install and works well

Knew what a bidet was but never thought of ever buying one..I always thought they were a separate bowl.  But i saw this..and upon its arrival I thought.." there is no way i will ever be able to figure out how to install this"...but..I read the instructions and did it. Pretty easy.  It takes a small amount of time to get used to using a bidet..figuring out how much pressure works with the water pressure of your system, but thats no big issue.  I feel clean and fresh down there now.  Highly recommended.

Super easy to install.  Took about 10 minutes.  Works good so far no leaks.  I do like that water line tools are included.  Now my wife wants one on all our toilets and I must say I agree.

I tried this at the suggestion of a friend. After the somewhat easy installation (tightening attachments so no more leaks), I still wasn't sure but as time has gone by, I am finding it is a good product.

This was our first bidet. Wish we had done this years ago. It's a good price point to see if it's an option you want to explore. Maybe we will upgrade eventually, but great introduction. My husband said it was super easy to install. The pressure is really strong. I didn't know what I was missing!

WASHER IS NOT INCLUDED, I HAD TO FIND OUT THE HARD WAY. DO NOT BUY THIS.

Stream aim was a little off.

Works like it is supposed to.Great that no connection to electric is required, hence no hot water is available but that is not a problem.For someone it may be, then get the one with that feature.

super higienico... exelente producto

Being pregnant with my third baby this bidet is a complete lifesaver! I wouldn't say I have gotten huge during my pregnancies but even still I am thankful for the extra help staying clean down there. Also all of the TMI details of pregnancy that happen down there are eased with having a bidet. After delivery this bidet kept proving its worth! I do believe having a bidet helped my body not only stay cleaner down there than an average spray bottle but also helped my body heal up quicker because I was always clean down there and did t need to scrub hard to achieve this and also the cool water helps bring down the swelling. I could go into much more details haha but I will spare you. Just know this bidet is completely worth the inexpensive price and the easy hook up! Get one and tell all your momma friends to get one as well!!!

I like that it is a self cleaning

Este producto est' genial, muy f'cil la instalaci'n y trabaja muy bien.

That the other 2 times I bought this brand the pressure was better. This time it just trickles water.

The spiket cover broke after 5 months

Second one of these I have purchased (for another bathroom).  10 minutes to install, using either the supplied tools or your own. Not fancy, no heated water or anything, but does the job it is designed for very well.

This is AMAZING!!!! I highly recommend.

You really want warm water cleaning your tush??. I purchased the least expensive and exchanging for the one with warm water application.  It's easy to install and will get the job done but that cold water??

Too complicated to install

I watched the video on Luxe's website of a woman installing the bidet and it gave me the confidence that I can do this. I've always wanted a bidet and this was so easy to install. It works too!

I've had two bidets of this model, and have generally enjoyed the experience while they worked.Unfortunately, both units started leaking from the control panel within a few months of installation. I don't have unusually high water pressure, so I feel like this must be a quality control issue.If Luxe Bidet could resolve this issue, I would consider purchasing again, but for now will be looking for another brand to see if I can avoid this problem.

My husbands NP recommended one after his back surgery. Immediately bought 2nd one for other bathroom. It's wonderful. Should have purchased years ago. Totally sanitary and much less use of toilet paper!!

No problems. Completely satisfied.

Returned

Does a great job. Have bought 3 now for all the bathrooms. Kids wanted one after trying parents bathroom.  15 yr old swears by it.

Easy to install and easy to use. Do have to move around to get clean and stuff but gets the job done.

I absolutely love having a bidet. It's cleaner and more sanitary than wiping, and saves a lot of money on toilet paper. In the early days of the COVID shutdown, when people were hoarding toilet paper and there was nary a roll to be found, I was golden. I hate not being able to use one when not at home.

I'm not a plumber. I've had a set of 2 Dr Mercola bidets for years and they're finally getting old so I decided to replace it.I don't know all the fancy names for parts like everyone else here, but I can tell you, this set doesn't line up with standard American toilet seats parts. My husband had installed the old bidets with ease, but with this, NO. I'm almost thinking they sent a set that was meant for European toilets or something.He's been back and forth to the hardware store several times, all to no avail. Parts don't fit.We were thinking about calling a plumber, but why should I have to spend even more money, especially the cost of a plumber?I'm sending it back for a refund.Save yourselves some headaches and don't buy this.Nothing should be this hard to install.

Excellent

Husband installed in an hour and it works perfectly! Totally worth it.

It was so easy to install it's have everything you need also cheap price ;)

After trying to install a couple of other bidets on amazon to no avail this one solved all my issues. It was very easy to install, experienced no leaks and its changed my toilet game! The amount of money you save on toilet paper trumps the cost of the product but forget that the cleanliness of a bidet is the real game changer.Once you try this product you will never go back to dry-wiping!

Let me start by saying that as an American, these need to become a bigger thing. My eyes have been open since the moment I tried it. Ordered about $100 worth of Dominos just to test it out and it passed the wipe test without issue. I may order the deluxe model that reclines next so I can catch a baseball game in peaceful bliss.One thing's for sure, the next time there's a TP shortage I'll be laughing at all the dirty butholed peasants. My only complaint is that having to go at Walmart will never be the same.

Have this for some time now and in not impressed with it.  It's inconsistent and doesn't do as good a job as I thought it would.

This is the perfect gift for that person who has everything. Well designed and built. Highly recommend.

Easy to install great product!

This product makes everything in the bathroom department easier.  Easy to install.  Easy to regulate.  Easy to clean.  I love ite!

First I got one for the toilet I use most often at my home (guest bathroom just off of my home office).  The wife was not a fan but now a couple of years later, they are on all the toilets in the house and even a few friends and family have now installed them in their homes.

Installation was effortless with the included instructions and video. The unit works great, the delivery time was remarkably quick.

This is a clean, comfortable and easy to use bidet. Works well but has very powerful jet.

Having to get this onto the toilet was the worse experience, kept missing the threads, would not go one, once we used a wrench to tighten it cracked the toilet bolt! Then it still leaked all over the place. Could not get it to work so we returned it

A friend got me addicted to this wonderful bidet. It was intimidating to install but... EVERYTHING is included. It was SO EASY!Get one for every bathroom you have!

I was ready to try this out. It doesn't work. It sprays water on my ball sack instead of the area it needs to. Maybe because I have a round toilet

If you are not familiar with bidets this is a great way to get started. After using you will not want to use restroom without it. Having a clean tush is so easy with this bidet and no other method compares, not even wipes. Somehow this thing was engineered to always spray in the right area every time. I'm just obsessed with bidets and thing it is a must have for every toilet. It will take time to convince others at home to use but let them give it a shot once and they will find its magic. This is my first bidet but find that I made the right choice with this. I will be installing in all my toilets. This was insanely easy to install in about 10-15 minutes. All components needed to install are included. This is not something you can buy at your box store. If the box stores offer this it is for closer to 100$. This was inexpensive, easy to install, and durable.

Aside from just having to twist old fasteners loose and in my case, break apart the old toilet seat (LOL) I was FINALLY able to EASILY ATTACH the LUXE BIDET! Life can never be the same again once you get a bidet! I HIGHLY recommend this product in particular AND that you get a BIDET for your booty hole!

Our previous Bidet (another brand) stopped working so we picked this new one to use. Works great for men and women. Saves on how much TP gets used, that's for sure!

No Media

Okay so you can't add hot water with this one or at least I didn't. I have ice cold water in the winter but I'll tell you what there is nothing more refreshing then having a squeaky clean behind. Honestly has helped with so many different bottom issues. Just open your mind and give it a try.

Wipes are better and cleaner than bidet.  Change my mind

The amount you save in toilet paper quickly pays this off. Plus you feel cleaner than ever before. Whenever I am out of town I can't wait to get back.

I have had this product for well over a year. It still works just like it did the day I got it.It was very easy to install. If you have any DIY experience you can do this. Just be sure and use the included teflon tape to prevent leaks. Don't over tighten the fittings it's not necessary. Mine has never leaked a drop.Let's talk about pressure. (This part might be a little gross) Have you ever had a soft stool, or one that's a little hard and won't come out. People complain about the pressure of this device. Folks it's adjustable. You just don't turn the know as far. But when you do have one of these problems use the pressure to get a mini enema. I will shoot water up and then the stool comes out with ease.I've had a lot of problems with an hemorrhoid.  This device keeps my butt ultra clean. So clean that my hemorrhoid issue is almost completely gone.You save on toilet paper also. Where before I had to wipe and wipe and wipe now one time to wipe and dry.Don't let other reviews scare you away this is the most accurate way I can describe this device.For me it's a Godsend!

I cannot stress enough how EASY it was to install that was my biggest fear. It is such amazing quality and it feels amazing it works incredible. Everything about it, the price, the installation and how great I feel using it BUY ONE!!! :)

Very irritating that I had to wait a week to receive the product and didn't find out until we installed it that we needed toilet seat bumpers!!  It won't work properly without them.  It should be made VERY CLEAR that they may be needed OR better yet, why not include them?  Can't imagine that it would add more than 50 cents to the cost of their product.  Now I have to wait another week to get them.... can't even pick them up at my local Home Depot or Lowe's.  Can't rate the actual product because we can't use it yet. URGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!

I had been eyeing a TUSHY for a while, but I just couldn't justify paying that much for a bidet attachment. I read the reviews for this product and decided to purchase it.I am so glad I purchased this product. Installation maybe took 15 minutes, as I have an 'older' version of a toilet seat. I had a bowl under the water valves to catch any excess water, and had to install the seat without the toilet seat adapter thingies, but it works perfectly fine. you can just rotate the toilet seat bolt so that it's a bit higher up than the original setup, and you might need to do some trial & error to get the right height to prevent the seat from wobbling but it wasn't too bad.I am very happy with the purchase, especially given the price.

For very little an American can wash his bum like most of the rest of the world using water. But this gadget is easy to install and does the work for you, so, it's very American. Game changer.

Got our first one and never going back. A++++ good for number 1, 2 and anything in between if you know what I mean. ??

There is no temperature control and softness depends on the pressure knob. I advise that one does not start on full blast because you may taste the water.... if ya know what I mean

I liked this bidet for the first 3 years. until it broke. The plastic cracked and split.  If you want a temporary bidet, go for this one.  If you want one that will last more than a couple years,  go with a different company.

I'm not the handiest when it comes to home repairs, but this was very straightforward to install and get up and running.  I only gave it 3 stars on Temp Control because there is none.  However, even without it, it works great and I feel much cleaner.

I bought two of them. They came packaged nicely. They were so easy to put on. They even had step by step instructions. A lot of companies don't do that. I thought that was impressive. They are very easy to use. I have to have back surgery and I hoped these would help for ''cleanliness'' afterward. So far it really seems like they will be a godsend after surgery. I like them and I am really glad I got them. My only complaint is that is does NOT show you HOW to use the clean function. I have no idea how to use it. I can't even find a video on it......HELP!!

This is an amazing product! I did not know I needed this product!

Easy to install

works well, not as easy to install as represented

Easy to use

From box to bottom, the installation was only about 30 minutes in total. Instructions were easy to follow and the parts supplied made it a snap. This is the second unit in my house, and I've bought two others for relatives!

Worked as expected for about 2 years. Now the nozzle doesn't retract automatically, even after routine cleaning.This renders the product useless, unless you want to manually retract the nozzle after each use.I guess it's time to retire it and upgrade to something better.

This bidet is wonderful.  It makes you feel cleaner than toilet paper and will pay for itself buy needing to buy less tp.

So easy to put on, took like 5 mins. You might have to adjust a few times to get the right angle which is kinda of annoying but once u find the right spot its great. There is no temperature option but the power of the stream has a nice range and its great that it has a self cleaning knob. Would recommend!

Great product. Who would of thought, a quick water bath, while you bend over and touch your toes, would end you up feeling refreshedAnd you didn't have to go broke buying this product

You'll never want to poo away from home again. These are easy to install and life changing

It was really easy to install. First time experience with a bidet and highly recommend it. During the toilet shortage I was stress free. I have saved a lot of money on toilet paper.

So easy to assemble. GAME CHANGER IN THE BATHROOM

No Media

Cheapest with great quality

It's great to have but I should have got hot and cold because the cold water in the winter it be like ice but it's great in the summer time

Good hygienic finish to your bathroom visits.

I am a 300 lb man and this thing is just what I needed. I don't know how I lived without it. I'm also not very mechanically inclined so I appreciate how easy it was to install. Everyone needs this 'power washer' on their toilet!

Overall it was good when first installed, then the dial that adjusted water pressure stopped working and is stuck on high

It'll make you want to squirt back. Clean with confidence.

How did I live without this most of my life? Bidet is the way to go.

Very easy to install, very functionable, well made and attractive.

I don't know why one of the rating categories is temperature control because there isn't with this or most bidets. It's the same water that goes into any sink or shower in your house. It isn't heated. EASY to install, high pressure, water will shoot about 8 feet in my house. Watch 1 install video and you'll be convinced you can fo it yourself.

This was an excellent purchase! Easy to install and works like a charm. I am so happy I purchased it.

We loved our bidet until it started to leak from inside, under the main knob.  It lasted 6 years.Luckily the leak started while we were at home and not on vacation, so we could shut down the water right away and avoid water damage to the adjacent bedroom's hardwood floor.

my first bidet and it works great, unreal how inexpensive this product is. get one, get clean.

No issues so far

It's just wasting time with this sellerI ordered five to same for no reason sent one different color. Poor customer service, poor productDo not buy from this seller.

This product didn't work at all. Didn't spray right and they jacked me around for months and would never allow a return or a refund. Stay far away.

Received product quickly and mounted within 20 minutes. Make sure to turn water supply off and flush several times until reservoir is empty.The pressure adjustment control goes from on to water jetting a new orfice very quickly. My control was full pressure by the second dot. A comfortable jet steam  is about 1/16 of an inch turn more than that it can be painful.I have read other reviews where people turned down their water supply valve. I don't want to listen to a toilet take 10minutes to fill.  Like it other than that aspect and feel much cleaner and better about not using so much paper and baby wipes. Big reduction in waste

The Luxe Bidit is economical, easy to install and works great! Tried other brands of Bidit and was very disappointed and ended up returning them. The Luxe Bidit is definitely a keeper!

It's easy to install and works great!

The bidet is a great value and easy to install. This was a gift for a good friend that I installed for her. I have previously purchased and installed 2 of these in the bathrooms in my house. I highly recommend this product!!

Easy installation .

Cleaner than TP!  Saves you money using less TP.  Everyone should be doing this.

The first few days the bidet worked great. After a few days of use the spout has been failing. Sometimes I get up from the toilet seat move the little box, make the mistake of turning the nozzle, water squirts out.Then when I sit down and turn nozzle again it doesn't work! So frustrating this has been happening more frequently and it's just so annoying.

Bathroom Hygiene - Reduce Toilet Paper Waste - Works Great!

Easy to install.  Quick connect, no leaks.Powerful enough for a cleansing systemI love mine. I installed 2!

Beats toilet paper!

You have to buy adapters for the toilet seat and it doesn't squirt in the right place.

Amazing product highly recommend very easy to use and install bought it for my wife as a Christmas gift and she was in love

Was a bit hesitant to order and try this but it is life changing! Nice water pressure, cleans well! So glad I decided on it. Husband installed without any issues.

Very good

I purchased 2 of this 120 bidet less than a year ago and they both leak now. Very frustrating to deal with. Never buying those again

It was easy to install and works great! I'm sorry to have waited so long before I decided to order one. I should've gotten one sooner

2 nozzles for women. Bought for the whole family. Great product!

Easy to install, looks appealing and works great.

It's pretty easy to install especially since the tools are included as well. The pressure is also much better than others that I've tried.

PRO: Easy to install and worksNEUTRAL: Need to remove stickers and residue stickiness before installing.CON: Toilet seat mounts on top of the bidet which leaves it suspended above the bowl. My seat is a plastic that will flex , a wooden seat would be less flexible. I will look for some 1/4" spacers to mount under the seat so that

NO DISLIKES, ALL WENT WELL. EVERY PURCHASE SHOULD BE SO EXCEPTIONAL.

love it, my uncle had one that i fell in love with. so i had to make the purchase myself. 10/10

Easy install. Set up was easy,adjustment easy, well worth the money. Here in Florida the water is warm, so that helps. One less thing for me to do, save for drying. Thanks.

shipped and delivered fast.  Works well and as expected.  Does what it is supposed to do.  Great value for the money.

Installed super fast, happy with it for what we paid. The model we got doesn't have temperature control. Gave it to husband as a Christmas gift and he was pretty pumped about it.

I love using a bidet now so much that I can't imagine not having one anymore. I feel so much cleaner and I save on toilet paper because I don't have to use nearly as much. So that's better for the environment too. I just wish I had one with temperature control, but I don't want to have to put in water lines all the way from my sink to the back of the toilet, so for now cold water is better than none at all!

Love this! Get a clean fresh feel with less toilet paper.

This is a good one !

Is this the best starter bidet? No. Is it my favorite? Yes. This thing will reach your large intestines.

Would be nice if had minor angle adjustment

First of all, the other reviews said it was great and easy to install. The instructions even say it fits any standard toilet. I turned off my water, removed the toilet seat, got the bidet lined up. Well. My screws aren't long enough now that I've attached the bidet. I called customer service to see if I was just doing something wrong- they told me to call the manufacturer for the toilet seat. I said no, I'll go get longer screws not the end of the world. But now, the back of the toilet seat is 1/2' taller than the front so I would need to find some sort of spacer to make the seat level. At the end of the day I'm returning it and looking for a brand that comes complete.

Thing is life changing. The only complaint (from my wife not me) is that the water is whatever your normal tap temperature is. If you live in Fargo...good luck.

The Bidet works well, as advertised, very pleased with it.  Thank you.

I love this bidet!The instructions for installing it were easy to follow and it was super easy to install. It only took about 20 minute. My husband and I both love it because of how easy it is to use and how clean you feel. I would recommend this to everyone.

I thought I had to buy an expensive seat to get the benefits of a bidet, but this easy accessory works perfectly.  Water out of the tap is not that cold and a fan is not necessary.  I use to have to jump into the shower several times a week to clean off and that's not very sanitary. This is so easy and fast, it takes the dread out of going.  My underwear now stays fresh all day.

I discovered this watching YouTube videos about RVing - a couple installed one in their RV and loved it.  I bought one and my wife and I loved it, too, and then bought another for the guest bathroom.  We used to buy tons of wipes, but the bidet does all the work so no need.  Bottom line is we paid a little for the bidet that works great and saved a lot by no longer buying wipes.  Highly recommend - and easy to install.  I don't recommend the bumpers they sell to make your standard seat fit better - leave well enough alone.  If your seat doesn't fit properly, you can pay $50 for the LUXE brand seat.  Seems to be highly rated, but I found we don't need it.

This is our 2nd unit, thanks covid. I hate going to bathroom away from home because I can't take this with me.Pros: it works really well, and depending on your angle, sometimes too well'you don't really need to upgrade to the feminine wash'this one hits it all just fine. Great, umm'strength control'barely go past 2nd bar unless you want an internal cleansing'Cons: if you have a house with man-child, it will get gross around where lid attaches to toilet. Unless aim is flawless, and despite their claims we all know it's not, you will need to take it apart from the bowl to clean it. You will also need to clean the nozzle etc on a regular because things can get messy in there, depending on how people are feeling. My children come to use our bathroom when they are home now because of it.I will replace this one when it's time comes, likely with the same one. It's really a great little treat for your rear, especially in the summer.

Easily assembled and works hist like it is supposed to.  Extremely satisfied customer.

Easy install and feels great

I could not install this bidet in the location I preferred and had to order a left hand version from another company since LUXE only makes right hand bidets.  Instead, I installed this one in a bathroom with fewer space constraints, and it works great for other members of my family.

Just great. Recommended

This is my first bidet. Installed it in my apartment's master bathroom over half a year ago. I had to order a toilet connector because after installing the one that was on the toilet was leaking. I have o idea how old that one was. The seal I guess wasn't tight enough, so you might want to buy a spare one before installing if you have an old toilet.The water pressure on the low levels is plenty strong and sprays far. It does take a few seconds for mine to start though. I think my toilet seat might be pressing down on it when I'm sitting and affect it so I have to lean forward a little for it to start.The cold water spraying you on a cold morning will definitely wake you up. I still use toilet paper to pat dry after.

Very easy to install I have cold water one not the warm and cold. Sensitivity control of water pressure easy to use. Very neat and elegant  bowl. LOVE it so far. Arrived sooner than expected. GREAT!!! Will let friends know they should purchase one. The price was great

The online videos made for an easy installation by my husband. But, the video he followed was an installation by a young woman. So you don't need a man to do it! We did have to purchase one small hose from Home Depot due to the way our toilet was configured. But not everyone will need that. But once installed it is so nice to feel clean after using the restroom. I found out those flushable towels you can buy are not really flushable! Especially if you have a septic tank like we do. I was worried about it not having a hot water source but the water comes out room temperature and is fine. I think everyone should have one of these!

Can't believe it took me this long to get one of these things. I never gave them much thought until a friend told me about it. Why would anyone need one of those silly butt cannon things? Aren't those just for rich European weirdos or something?Nope. That was just my silly pre-conception. Imagine having a clean butt all the time. Nice, right? This thing will absolutely delight you and change your life. The quality of life improvement here cannot be understated. You will leave the toilet feeling fresh every single time you go #2. You will hardly wipe, will mostly just pat yourself dry. Say goodbye to magic marker butt - no more wiping 9 times with half a roll of toilet paper, wondering if you got it all, or jumping into the shower for really stubborn disgusting messes.Did I mention you will feel fresh every time? No nuggets left behind or potential surprise streaks for mom to see in your underwear when doing laundry. This bidet will minimize or eliminate all of that nasty embarrassment.Really, if you are on the fence about getting one of these things, jump off. The sensation is pleasant, even with colder water. I think that might be what turns some people off - the potential for a cold or jarring feeling.It's not freezing cold - it's room temperature or somewhat cooler which is quite soothing for your bits of joy. Just think of it like splashing cool water on your face to refresh yourself. It feels nice, doesn't it? Now just take that and imagine aiming it at your choo choo train in a nice concentrated burst. You'll feel refreshed, guaranteed!Surprise yourself and up your hygiene game. You will be very, very glad you did. It's really one of the best investments I've made.

I bought 2 of the TUSHY brand bidets and they are great so I decided I wanted to add one to the guest half bath downstairs.  I noticed the price on this was better and its just the downstairs so I decided to give it a go and its POWERFUL (adjust the water pressure and you won't fly off the seat). It doesn't have adjustments for front and back but if I'm being honest, I don't really care because you just lean into the spot if you know what I mean.  Im not sure why I chose blue because it doesn't exactly blend but this is a very minor detail.If you notice in the photo, the bidet has a piece that covers the "spout" and it comes around when it's time to use it but I love that because I don't want it to be contaminated by someone who may stand up and pee on it.  Lol.  Sorry that's the only nice way to say it.  I think I'm officially team luxe over tushy for price, quality, the tools etc.  Im still amazed by the deal in comparison and that piece that covers is a very nice touch.I think the tools included make this a better investment than TUSHY.  They are both great but dollar for dollar, this is where I would go if I needed another but I'm so set.  These really are game changers from just feeling cleaner and more refreshed to less waste in TP.  Very satisfied.  I will say that all of the bidets make it look super easy to install but for me, I tried and I'm not terrible with fixing things around the house but I had to call my plumber both times I installed.  It must just be me because it's easy for everyone else apparently but I needed a pros help.  ANOTHER BONUS TO THE LUXE, IT COMES WITH A COUPON FOR TASK RABBIT TO HELP SHOULD YOU NEED IT.  Its just an impressive brand for the money.Last thing.....I thought bidets required hook up to hot and cold water as well as an electrical outlet for a warmer or dryer....I didn't have that option and I am here to say it's fine.  It's not ice cold (Im sure where you live is important but my water out of the tap is pretty darn cold but not this.  I doubt I would want it warmed up.  It's refreshing, I'll leave it at that but what a deal!!  Pat dry with a little TP and you're good to go.Bidets just make good sense.

We received a used bidet. Arrived dirty with signs it had been installed. Gross!

Easy to install, it does exactly what its supposed to do! ??

So easy to install! We love it

If you have never had a bidet before you will love this because having any bidet is better than no bidetHowever as I have had several this is very average to below average in quality.  Because of the time spent to install I'll likely live with it for a while and eventually buy a new brand

Best gift ever! Easy to install, easy to use and no issues so far. Definitely recommended for anyone wanting a bidet for a reasonable amount.

I was looking for a device to install on my toilet  My daughter guidons to Luxe Bidet.  I got it and installed it like magic. Excellent guide to install. You get all need to install in one package. The result of using it excellent especially in winter time. And made me feel clean an comfortable. Many thanks for who invented this device.

After roughly three months, I threw this away today. It frequently failed to operate properly; water would shoot straight down instead of where it should have (the self-clean was not turned on. It was set to work as a bidet.). Also, would not recommend for a round toilet. The bidet stuck out just far enough to... create an unwanted cleaning project (self-cleaning cannot fix that).

I love the fact that I can control the temperature to where I want it. It was not so easy to install.. and it's not harsh on us. It's soft..

Product is great, but most impressive is the customer service of this company. I emailed with a question and immediately received a response and answer. Emailed a couple times back and forth. Refreshing to have a company who is invested in their customers. I appreciate that.

I like it

Wayyyy to cold.  I'll be buying a electric style

Under the bidet control unit is leaking under the small hole under the control unit that means the sealant inside the control mechanism is not sealed correctly. The hose was dry and the white arm coming from the toilet is dry. There is a small hole under the control unit that it's leaking from.

I have been wanting a bidet attachment for years. I discovered bidets over 40 years ago in EUrope and the bidet hose while in India and have dreamt of one here in the USA ever since. The cold water is not a problem, it was easy to install and works wonderfully- in short, FABULOUS!

We placed order two of them. One for them was for guest bathroom. We installed it but never used it for a while. As it was started being used we figured out that it is not working properly. Guess what? Return date was over!

THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I HAVE EVER BOUGHT FOR ME!!!!!  IT WORKS

Pressure on this thing will have you jump up and then there's water all over your bathroom ??. But great buy! I restocked toilet paper in the house in July! I JUST pulled out the last roll.

I've installed these bidets before but noticed that they aren't comparable with these toilet seats with the tiny lip curve as shown on pictures.

(Written by Pat's wife, a female):  This is my 3rd bidet, all purchased from Amazon. The first had both cold and warm water, which I liked, but is not really necessary in Vegas, so I left it behind when I moved. It worked great. The second one had a dial that rotated up and down (like a doorknob). After a few months, the arm developed a crack and leaked, eventually shooting water straight up, despite a McGyver repair.When I selected this one, I assumed it would have a setting for front and back and cleaning, but it has one for me and one for cleaning. Not a huge problem'you just adjust your own position, but this is something I never experienced before. HOWEVER, be prepared to be blasted!!  If NASA doesn't know about this, it should, because they could use it on their booster rockets. I'm not going to turn my water pressure down, but even if I did, I don't think I would ever use anything other than the lowest of the 5 settings. Don't accidentally turn it on without sitting down'you'll likely take the paint off your bathroom wall.That being said, it was very easy to install. I think the horizontal dial is a better feature than the previous one.

This was an easy install. We recommend that Lux include the larger seat bumpers in the kit. We ordered them after the install.

This bidet is a good addition to the home. It was easy to install once I watched a video on it. No major toolsneeded. The different water pressure options are nice too.Many people are nervous about using a bidet, but once you try it a few times it becomes more normal in daily use. I actually prefer having one than not. I still use toilet paper, but not as much.As far as water temperature, whatever the temperature is outside the water will feel that way. Recently, it was in the negatives outside so the water was pretty cold shooting out the nozzle. Still used it as is though.This was not an expensive purchase so for me it was worth buying and trying. I will be keeping it until it stops working.

Had a problem (after the warrantee period) with one of the knobs -- they answered my email in one day and are shipping a replacement  knob FREE.Thank You  !!!

Have been wanting to purchase a bidet for quite a while, but did not want to pay tons of money for one. Decided to take my chances with this one and have been highly impressed. Took less than 10 minutes to install and works as intended. Very cold water due to not having a hot water hookup, but I knew that when I purchased it. Would recommend for anyone who wants a good bidet at a lower price point.

Just got it installed yesterday.  Very simple to install!  Works just like it is supposed to.  The company has apparent pride in their product because each item was packaged so as to arrive in pristine condition and the unit looks nice.  In spite of being low priced, it does not look or feel cheap.  They thought of everything I would need clear down to a small roll of Teflon tape.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  As an entry level device, it is perfect.

I love this bidet. It's very easy to install and works great. This is much more sanitary than toilet paper, and pays for itself. After the toilet paper shortage during Covid, we bought this bidet and it is definitely worth it.

I HAVE PURCHASED THREE TIMES. HAVE NO PERFORMANCE ISSUE. STILL WORKING IN GOOD CONDITION. LOVE AND LIKE THE WAY CLEAN THE BOWL MOVEMENT. I AM SAVING LOTS OF PAPER TOWN WHICH IN FACT CUT THE COST OF PURCHASING BATHROOM TISSUE

It's good for your first. I'm about 3 months into it, still love it, but I know if I spend a bit more money it'll be even better. So I'll probably spend a bit more on my next. And there will be a next. This feature is too fine to stop voluntarily.

Unfortunately this is not heated, and hooks directly into the water line going to the toilet. It works as expected, but does use the cold water line running to the toilet.Overall a great product.

Between the cheeks I feel like a hero

We LOVE these and recommend them highly. We hate to stay in hotels or private homes knowing they won't have them. Absolutely esssential

Great price!

Returning item for the 3rd time after the nozzle protector breaks and then everything leaks after

Works great.Exactly as describedEasy to install

good product for the cost. was a little tough to installl, but managed it. rightly priced. liked it overall

There is no temperature control on this model, it's your butt what do you need temperature control for, as for softness, isn't that was the pressure control is for?

I have had this bidet for three years now, and I love it. At the start of the pandemic, toilet paper became hard to find so I bought this instead. It installs in just a few minutes and it does an awesome job.  If you suffer from hemorrhoids, this is the way to go. I was weeks away from needing surgery, and now they don't bother me at all. I feel like a savage now when I have to use dry paper to wipe. Cold water on your business can be off-putting initially, but you get use to it really quickly. Quality materials and it is very user friendly. Get it!

Looks good, works as needed, little bit hard to install.

Brother in law liked mine so he purchased one for himself.

Love it but does not have temp control water is a little cold ??

I love the bidet. Never used one before but now I can't imagine not having one. With that said I wish I'd spent more for a nicer one.No temperature control? Fine.But the design is kinda crappy. 5' turn and it's a water fountain. 6' turn and you're in danger of stripping the paint off your behind.This thing will clean you inside and out.I will say if your toilet has a connector pipe with a plastic clamp order one with a metal clamp before trying to install else you will need to take a trip to Home Depot like I did.I'd say this is a good starter bidet. Try it out and if you like it you can move it to another bathroom and upgrade down the line.

Easy to install.

I suffer from spinal stenosis very painful This device is fantastic way to keep clean, and works just great. had it for 3 weeks and love it.

Easy to install.  This one does not hook up to the hot water, but it does the job. For those who suffer from Chronic diarrhea due to illness, or elderly infirmities with personal hygiene, I highly recommend it

good

Works great! Easy installation!??

Honestly This is a must have! I don't understnad why anyone woulnt have a bidet! If you had poop on your arm would you just wipe it off with a dry paper towel and go about your day? Then why would you do that with your butt?

Unfortunately this product doesn't hold up over time. My knobs are peeling and turning green. A little disappointed.

Need a spacer or something for the front of the seat. The rear of the seat, where it connects, rises and the seat in the front then has a gap which compresses when you sit, destroying the plastic. Also the plate for self cleaning rips apart very quickly

Rear only. Super easy to install.

about 1 year ago i went all in on the toto washlet $1000. It stop spraying water after 11 months of use ! What a rip that was. Our toto is now a $1000. dollar seat warmer/ lame dryer. After spending $1000. on toto i had to figure out how to rig something up so I bought this unit and let me tell you. Its much more powerful than the toto. Its basic but for around $30. Ill take no thrills. The toto did have warm water and this one is putting out ice water. As of right now im fine with that. If you see this same review on another affordable seat its because i bought 2 to try out. I needed a thin unit so i could install it under the toto in order to i enjoy my $1000 seat warmer and air dryer. I love this unit !

Not as good as others

No Media

this unit comes with all the parts and tools necessary to install. All you will need is a screwdriver to remove the toilet seat bolts. It's very easy to install, and works well.

Seriously... Buy this product.

Many family members have tried it and love it.  I wouldn't recommend that someone who doesn't know their way around a tool box to install it though.  Make sure you know what you're doing. Very nice product.

Considering that my husband and I have NO handyman skills (I mean NONE), we were able to complete this ourselves.  It works all right.  The pressure is kind of hard to adjust and you have to move yourself around just a little to get the spray exactly where you want it.  I like that it uses warm water so that's a plus.  I won't ever go back to being without one but the next one will have air dry as well.

Started using it for a while. Loving it so much'eco friendly but only issue is during winter as it cannot turn the cold water into hot..: but great product

The cover for the bidet spray fell off and clogged he toilet. I can't seem to get it to drain properly. May her to call a plumber.

Super easy to install, find your setting because full blast is doozy . Overall super satisfied it's awesome for the price .

I should have paid closer attention.  The water doesn't heat so it's very cold water that comes out.  Might be handy in the summer when this will feel refreshing but for now, I hesitate using!

Get this one - I have tried several with super catchy marketing and awful quality and performance but this basic one out performs all of them - great value and super performance really cleans where others several times more expensive won't.

Never thought of using this but once one of my friends recommended it, I ordered it from Amazon. I have been using this for a 2 weeks now & I am really happy with this. Worth trying!

The reviews were right about this thing. Easy to install, the water does not feel cold when you use it and works better than I though it would for the price. Looks amazing for a cheap plastic item but feels very durable and easy to use. I'm not going to get all personal like some others but this thing is spot on and will come in handy for sticky situations. Don't forget to buy the pads for the seat. It make everything stay perfectly even and looks professional. Great product and will probably get another for the spare bath. Would absolutely buy again.

Simple but that's exactly what I wanted was simple. Very easy to install, very few settings, but you can vary the water pressure which is pretty much all that's needed for a basic bidet. Quality product for a great price!!!

Skeptical but it works great

First of all I am not a fine bidet connoissuer. I bought my first bidet, this exact model, on black Friday from Walmart in 2021. I installed it in early 2022, the installation takes a couple minutes and as long as you're able to follow simple instructions you'll be fine. Little did I know how life changing this little device was.First Impressions: This bidet has a really good aim, and you may want turn down your water pressure a bit. The first time it nails you right in the bung hole it can be jarring. Don't scream and jump off the toilet, that'll just make a water mess. I move around a bit on the seat so it isn't a constant spray directly onto my rectum, this makes it less jarring and cleans all around.Long Term: I've been using it for almost a year now and it has changed my life. No matter how clean you think you are getting with TP and/or wet wipes you aren't getting as clean down there as you will (very quickly) with this bidet power washing your bum. I, like many, used to prefer to poop at work, just so I could be getting paid to do it. Now I much prefer and sometimes even hold it so that I can poo at home where my bidet is.Features: The lone downside to this bidet is that it isn't a warm water bidet, so you'll have to get used to cold water (which isn't that hard to do). The spray heads are behind a guard that hangs down into your toilet above the water level, so they should remain clean all the time. There are two knobs, one of them if you turn it one one way it controls the water pressure to spray, and the other direction past the neutral position is a spray head cleaner to rinse off your spray heads is necessary. The other knob controls direction. As a man I just keep mine set all the way to the back, I don't have anything up front to spray clean so I can't comment on that, other than i can affirm that it does indeed spray more towards the front. Set all the way back I can wiggle about and get the entire region clean.Overall: I love it. I'm getting one for every family unit in my family for Christmas. It easily pays for itself since you'll no longer need toilet paper. It saves you from clogs and problems with the sewers or septic system. It's much easier for people with limited mobility to use. Plus properly cleaning down there for women helps prevent infections. There's no negatives to making this switch, I would just recommend keeping a towel or hand towel in place specifically for quick drying purposes.

I love this bidet. It was very simple to install, and so far, seems to be of very good quality. I took another reviewer's advice and bought the deluxe valve, which is definitely not necessary, but adds one more level of control and luxury. The T adapter that came with the bidet is fine for virtually all installations in my opinion. I have 70 psi at my house, and the bidet's normal pressure control works fine.I love that it's self cleaning!I recommend this for anyone wanting a bidet.

I finally get what all the fuss is about. If you don't already have a bidet, you should seriously get one. Fantastic investment and I definitely saves money on toilet paper.Consider getting one everyone. No regrets.Also, get a longer flexible pipe than you think you need.

I have toyed around with the idea of buying a bidet for years, and finally did it, I'm so glad we did! It's so nice, we have one on both toilets now. It was super easy to install, it took my husband and I may be 15 minutes per toilet, not exaggerating the amount of time it took. It's so great! I feel so clean!Even though this specific product is not heated, I don't really mind that the water is cold! If you're on the fence about buying a big day or you're worried that this one will not be as good as the Tushy, I assure you, this is just as good, maybe better! We are now using only one roll of toilet paper, per bathroom, per week! This is definitely going to save us money in the long run.

Since you don't have the ability to adjust temp it is a little startling at first. I suffer from IBS and this has been a butt saver!

Easy to use & saved toilet papers

I didn't order the temp control unit.

Been using it for 5 years. Trouble free. Won't be without a bidet ever again.

Easy to install

Product was delivered promptly. Easy installation. Satisfied

I am finally writing a review... now that it's finally broken... but it took it about 5yrs from purchase date. I bought this first after we went to Indonesia to visit one of our past exchange students and we discovered the miracles of the bidet and instantly wanted it after stomach flu from the trip was triggered... this proved just what we needed.  Here are what we found:Pros:- 5yrs seems like a pretty good durability for the cost- It was fairly simple to install... I mean it could be easier and some of the connective parts seems like it could be better quality... but they all held up for 5yrs, it was the control unit that finally had a leak that broke the deal for me... I was even able to switch the controls when that semi-broke- It just worked... for 5yrs... no frills, no glamor... it just worked and it looked fairly high priced- The pressure, which is also a con since it's so strong, is really good for getting the job doneCons:- As stated above, some of the parts could have had better quality, especially the dial for the control... that semi-broke first but I was able to make do with it- There were almost no pressure control... 20% of the way or less is 100% pressure... you just have to give yourself a water enema every time you use itOverall, I am seriously considering buying it again... but maybe something else?  It sucks that I found it leaking past midnight... but it lasted a good 5yrs.Final question: how to stop visiting children from playing with this... I have yet to find an answer...

Perfect for keeping fresh

I bought this years ago. Loved it. So I got it as a gift !

I just replaced a hand held bidet sprayer with this. It's great that I don't have to reach under there now but the stream of water can carry the nasty residue to the gap between the seat and rim and run down the front of the pedestal. (Sorry , gross, I know.) You really need to keep the pressure low! Fortunately the dial controller is very precise. If you crank it up too high, it can be painful too. Go slow! I liked it enough to order a second one for the other pot.

Once you start using a bidet you will never go back to just paper. My family loves it.

The selector knobs are cheap. I know we use it daily but I've had the knobs on two different bidets break. Had no luck finding replacement knobs.

Best investment I've made in quite some time.  High Quality, works perfect and very easy to install. Worth three times what it cost...YOU CAN"T GO WRONG HERE!

Have two for about two years. Installed in about 20 minutes! Hoses won't leak. Knobs are durable and won't break. Water jet had good pressure adjustment. Easy and reliable self-cleaning. Nozzles are durable and haven't failed to work as advertised.

It had good reviews so I bought it. This is my third bidet, I have bought several types. They are all made in China I think. Two started leaking after about a year. Bought this to replace one in the master bath. The toilet seat will not sit flat with this unit. I also find the stream to be too gentle. The goal is to use no TP except to dry off. I would buy something else. In fact, I probably will.

It's an excellent bidet, and works great.  But first, the cons:CONS:  There are 2 stickers on the bidet to be removed.  One explains the guard gate, the other gives an ID and customer care phone number.  Their adhesive is really good.  You can peel the stickers off, but the adhesive requires special chemicals ("adhesive remover," of all things) to clean off.This bidet is supposed to be white, and it's close, but not really white.  See my photographs.  It doesn't have quite the rose tint in the photos -- I'd call it "off white" or "antique white."PROS:  It's very easy to install, and it works very well.  I've had a similar bidet for several years on a different toilet, and this ones works just as well.  I appreciate the water being cold, so I know exactly where it hits me.  And I appreciate how simple this bidet is.  No electricity, and a simple water hook-up.Quality is good, instructions are good ((English!), too.  The cons I mentioned are minor, especially considering the price of this bidet.  If it cost $100, I'd give it a lower rating, but geeze.  I don't know how they produce this at the given price.  I've used multi-thousand-dollar bidets that come with all sorts of features and complexities.  I prefer this one.  It works great, does what I want, and is simple and easy to keep clean.  Five stars.

I have been looking for something like this for a while now and it was just delivered today. It was easy to install and when I tried it out, I must say it was like having a cheap thrill, it left me feeling great and clean.

It works great, this is my second one and I love this brand.

Installation was quick and easy, and the bidet works PERFECTLY!!!! I even think I hear squeaking when I walk!

Amazing

Really easy to install and works great. Some people are hesitant to try a bidet when when they do they become loyal bidet users like everyone in my family. I had an issue with a leak in my buddy almost 2 years after my purchase, I submitted a warranty claim and had a brand new one for free within a week.

Easy to install and we have the cleanest butts in town!

Misleading

bidet raises back of toilet seat but not front. the front being lower pushed bidet into rear toilet rim causing the sprayer to not want to come out and preventing it from working. to make work i have to lift up slightly from seat, problem would be solved with riser "legs" for the front of the seat

And it could last longer, but we broke it due to reckless cleaning, my wife loved this everyday, excellent quality and design, functionality top notch.

We had to install it in a different bathroom than planned, one with a newer toilet, but it works great and helps reduce the amount of paper used.

The instal was super easy, I like the change in pressure option. I can't live life without one now

The only thing that I dislike is the initial blast of cold water but that is to be expected. Installation went with no problems.

Installation was a breeze and it functions well, but it requires a separate water pressure regulator. And it has to be one from them. Otherwise the built in pressure knob only goes from extremely high pressure to basically pressure washer pressure. It's a common issue and the company knows it. They just recommend in the installation manual that you 'purchase their part'.

I wasn't sure about buying this and my friend had this one and loved it . I love it too

Once I installed this, I used maybe 1/4 or less TP, mainly just to "dry off" back there. I've gotten so used to it now that I get a little disappointed when I have to "go" at work cause I don't feel as clean lolz. Took a bit of getting used to, but I'll always have one on any toilet I get

I love love love it! My coworker was raving about her bidet so I had to buy one and it was honestly the best decision I've ever made. Only thing that sucks is the water comes out very cold (I live in Washington state and it's like 20' outside) but I'll live.

You can't adjust the direction of the nozzle like you can on other products. So if you have install it slightly incorrectly the water might miss your bum. Just keep that in mind whenever you're using it. The spray is also pretty wide, I assume for this reason, so water tends to get on your cheeks no matter how well adjusted it is.

So far so good. I am having a hip replacement and I feel this will be so convenient. I will send another review later.

So easy to install and it works very well. Pressure is adjustable and the self cleaning feature is wonderful.

I don't know how I ever did without this. Works as advertised and is very easy to install. Will see how it holds up over time, but I know I won't be without one from now on.

If I had this nozzle on my water hose I could etch the concrete outside

I had one of these before, so for my new home I had bought 4 of them, one for each bathroom. They did their job well.However, just after their guarantee period ended (1.5 years), they started to break. It starts with the unit leaking water out of the flow control area. I thought perhaps there was a leak from the pipe, but it wasn't that. It turns out that the plastic where the spout sits under the toilet seat cracked, and that water was leaking from them and rolling down towards the control area.This same break happened to the other 2 units. The only unit that didn't break was in the guest bathroom, because it is rarely used. My wife is about 120lbs, and I'm 200lbs, so it's not as if there was an elephant sitting on the toilet to crush the plastic lol.So I have to replace these now, but I can't use this brand because I am pretty certain the same thing will happen again.

Good, but I had to buy bumpers to adjust for how it raised the seat

Reduces TP use and more''

i never write reviews.. but this Bidet is so great , after first order, I ordered 3 more'you will never go back.

This might just be a one time problem, but I'm pretty sure that the one that I got was missing some pieces. I could have gone out and tried to get more connecting connecting pieces, but decided to just return it

Cleaning control part doesnt work! You also need the correct toilet seat so make sure you research before buying or you will be spending another $50.00!

Only lasted 3 months before breaking and that's from one person using it

Had a colonoscopy on the horizon and saw this as a suggestion to ease the dreaded night before prep.  Apparently, during the great TP shortage, lots of folks got these and left great reviews.  Couldn't agree more.Only reason our installation wasn't super simple is because our house is old and the connections under the toilet were frozen tight, so before we damaged something,  we went to turn off all the water and that hasn't been done in a few years, so that was a bit 'involved.' We did get a much shorter connection at home depot for about $6. Also, when I ordered the bidet,  also ordered the 'bumpers' to go under & lift the front of the seat. I do suggest this.So, despite our old plumbing causing a little more concern, it was still a simple install and performance had been great.  I now HATE having to do number two anywhere besides the house!  One good squirt, a quick drying wipe and go.  Also, I cannot imagine how bad my procedure prep would've been without this!!Been using it about 3 months.  Love. Love,  love it!

Garbage, the nozzle pops down maybe once in a hundred times if lucky, the manufacturer wants you to play with the nozzle for awhile, seriously like I want to put my hand in a toilet to play with their nozzle, huge difference in opinions on how things are supposed to work.  I feel like I should be provided a quality product yet they think I should fix the junk they send.  Screwed on the refund, didn't save the original box, which who would want a used bidet?!  Absolutely ridiculous, think I take a break from Amazon all together on this purchase, good bye and good riddance to junk!  Like to reiterate my annoyance and frustration towards this garbage product and Amazon for allowing it to be sold and not allowing a refund or replacement, screw Amazon!!!!!!

I was having back fusion and not allowed to bend it twist, do we put this in to make it easier for me.  Had to get another hose that was flexible since the one on our toilet was not, but it works frest snd I love it!

The amount of people who's lives have been changed by my bidet.... EVERY FAMILY SHOULD HAVE ONE!!! Helps save on toilet paper usage, makes you feel very clean, a great conversation starter; everywhere I move to I've brought it along! The only downside that I'm still navigated is the toilet seat gap that happens during installation. You will need some bumpers to help. I'm still searching for the best ones though, cause they can be eaten by your toilet! But I will not be deterred from using my bidet!!!

Never felt so clean! I live in a city where the drain lines to the city sewers are notoriously poor. We are constantly plunging the toilets in our house. Installing bidet took 15 minutes top (and I'm a female who knows nothing about plumbing). The water comes from the toilet supply line (not the tank) so the water temperature is the same as it would be coming out of a faucet initially...as in it can be a bit chilly on those cold, winter days.

Excelente producto

This was purchased because I couldn't wipe after back surgery.  Now we're sold on it's continued use, for it works great.  As the second pic shows, my existing seat is low, so when sat on, the sprayer doesn't pop out to properly spray.  So I purchased the lift bumpers and that fixed the installation.  Be sure to use an alcohol wipe to clean and prep where you wish to place the bumpers for a good stick!

Leaves you clean. Strong pressure

Easy to install. No temperature  contro. Only cold.

Great, thank you

Being a guy, I thought that this would be a waste, but my wife wanted it.  However, I LOVE it.  (no more butt rash...)  I bought a 2nd one for our other toilet.  Now I'm buying my 3rd one to fit my RV john.  The first one is going on 3 1/2 years, with no problems or issues.  Use COLD water.  Even in the winter, the cold was OK.  Quite a bit less T-Paper use, too.  Very well made, and pretty easy to install.  Buy the Bidet T-Adapter w/ Shut off valve, too.

I've wanted a bidet since my first visit to Paris years ago. I read an article about quick home improvements and it mentioned bidets. I ordered this basic model and just finished installing it all by myself. Only regret is it took me this long to discover that these existed. My biggest frustration was lining up the hoses and adapter...I was twisting the wrong way and crouched down in the corner behind the toilet made it hard. Despite that, no leaks and it works perfectly, and the cold water is room temp, so it feels fine. My toilet seat hinges don't cover the bidet mounting adjustment plates, so that doesn't look too sleek, but otherwise I'm a happy camper. I love this so much, I'm thinking about giving these as gifts! :)

Ordered this item and promptly installed it. It makes using the bathroom most desirable and sooths the chaffing areas of my buttocks.

The metal T adapter only leaked no matter how much I tightened.  Call customer service.  Company is sending free of charge a plastic t adapter.  Will let you know how that goes

Not great if you have well water, even with the filter it gets clogged and the door broke on it already that covers the nozzle.

So, My sister and Brother in-law purchased this a year ago. I basically refused to use it. Then I used it and before even standing up, I had completed the order for my own. I'd be willing to bet the first month you own this it will pay for nearly half itself with Toilet paper savings.  I mean, for the 40 bucks I spent on this thing and the actual cleansing it does, I can see why Bidets are so popular around the world. My house hold went from using a Roll a day to a 1/10th of that. Talk about saving Trees lol. There is a also a Freshness that follows its use. like you just washed your Arse instead of used paper to smoosh Crap around it.

This thing is AMAZEBALLS! I've learned to adjust it so I'm not getting a colonoscopy every time. It's amazing and I'm spoiled when I have to use the potty without one of these!

I liked how easy it was to install, as well as the option for a rear cleanse.

All of ours failed in less than two years. The nozzles will fail to come out and spray. Also, the spray is sharp and uncomfortable. I don't recommend this low quality product.

I never knew how great a bidet is. I hate using toilets that don't have one now. My husband is the same way. We have a small vacation house at the coast and we had to have one there also. I am giving both of my children one for Christmas. Don't hesitate, order one now!

Works as advertised...Well made...

There is no better way to use the restroom. I love it.

10 minute installation? Yeah right.I spent over an hour trying to install it, finally got it and turned it on and every connection was leaking. Redid everything, made sure everything was tight and taped, still leaking.Ripped it out and immediately threw it away.

This product is necessary for my mother. We had an older model for a few years and it started leaking so replaced easily and is much better quality than the first. It is quite powerful.. go slow. Save paper, get clean and installation is a breeze.

I absolutely have loved my bidet SO Much! I'm super bummed cause the nozzle broke! I really hope LUXE comes through with some love.

Absolutely love this thing. It was very easy to install and it came with everything I needed to install the unit. I truly recommend this bidet.

This product is amazing for the money. Due to back problems, I can no longer reach to use toilet paper. I wouldn't now if I could. The jet of water exerts enough force to clean thoroughly but not enough to be the least bit  uncomfortable. It hits the target with no adjustments needed.  I am now buying them for gifts. AMAZING!

I don't use it as much in the winter because I didn't get the heated water one. Cold on the tush but it has a way of keeping me feeling fresh as a Daisy

I've bought this bidet for multiple bathrooms over many years for our home. It is super easy to install (no tools needed, max 10 minutes to install) and works perfectly. I've given this bidet to my parents for their home as well. Even when guests come over they ask for this brand and will order it for their homes as well.

I have three Luxe Bidets in my home and I couldn't be more satisfied. I got this one, with the self-cleaning feature, for a friend/co-worker to introduce her to bidet life! Don't ask me how we got on the subject at work, but we did. Our other coworker is also a Bidet fan so it was easy to talk it up. The price is reasonable, it's easy to install and operate. She put it in as soon as she got home and loves it. She says she'll never go back.

I won't go into detail, but I don't know where this thing has been all my life.  If you've never used a bidet, buy this.  You will have no regrets (and will be incredibly clean).This bidet is simple to install and use.  It does not have any advanced features, yet gets the job done.  I've been using this bidet for over a year and a half with no issues.

Easy to install, easy to us! Adjustable water pressure and adjustable nozzle to make cleaning easy.

my booty is SOOOOO clean. and im a hairy dude, this is a must for every hairy bootied individual.

This is the best purchase I have made this year.

Pros:SoothingEasy to useEasy to installBuying less toilet paperCost savingCons:Cold waterSuper strength powerCan be difficult to cleanIn the height of the toilet paper pandemic, I started looking into other options in case I could not find and buy toilet paper. I was also looking into some cost saving measures so I did not have to buy as many paper products. I bought this after seeing some great reviews. This is not the fanciest bidet you will ever use. The spray is cold water and it is powerful. I always barely turn it on. It does the job, cleaning and soothing. There has been many times I have been very grateful to have this product. You know those sick nights when you have used toilet paper too much and now you need some cold water soothing?? I also believe this has helped me cut back on the many UTIs I would get. People still think I am crazy for owning this but don't know it until you try it!

My hubby hooked this up in a matter of mins. Very useful and no issues. Ive been using it for 3 monthsnow.

This product is great. I think all homes should have this installed in their toilet.

I really enjoy the Bidet, but this is the second one that I have had issues with.  The first worked great for about 2 weeks then it started leaking water from the flow control.  Then I purchased another, again it worked perfect for a week.  Now the spray nozzle sometimes does not want to fully extend.  Have to play with it until it starts to spray correctly.  I haven't requested a money back or complained because I like the concept.

This is the easiest effective thing! I live in Canada half the year, and the water is way too cold to consider one like this, so mostly they sell heated ones, which require electricity, etc. and cost about $400. No electricity on this one, the install is very easy, and it works wonderfully. WAY MORE POWERFUL SPRAY THAN  MY ONE UP NORTH! Just a tiny opening of the valve is all you need to get all the cleaning you could want. Everyone should have one!

Works well and easy to i stall!

Our family love it.

I never used a bidet before but was diagnosed with stage 1 colon cancer and have to undergo bowel prep for testing every six months.  This Luxe bidet has been a lifesaver because it gets you very clean without the irritation (and expense) of paper products.  Without TMI, it's gentle but much more hygienic than using toilet paper - now I don't feel clean using a regular toilet.  My husband scoffed at this purchase but now I can't get him out of my bathroom.  I plan to purchase Luxe bidets for all our bathrooms.

Easy to install. Water pressure control is great. Not sure why it asks me to rate temperature control feature when the product doesn't have it. Would definitely recommend.

My husband finally installed my bidet after almost 6 month of having it! He decided to change both the comode before tge holiday comes and install the bidet in one of them. i love using it! I just bought another one for the guest bathroom!

That I needed one until after I used it for the first time. Clean wipes EVERY time. Amazing product, and I've never felt fresher.

Easy to use

The user manual is really helpful. It helped me all the way to install it. It makes my bathroom look really good

Please keep in mind it only has cold water. And it is only a single water nozzle. It's very basic but definitely love it regardless!

Would have been 5stars, but knobs broke at 1and 2years, otherwise good product, cut toilet paper cost in half. Haven't snaked line in 2yrs.

I love everything about it

Great water control,easy to install, perfect for seniors, and you will never have to spend alot on toilet paper again!!!

Perfecto, aunque tuve que comprar aparte unos tacos para levantar un poco m's la base de sentarse para que no le hiciera presi'n al sentarse y pudiera bajar bien la tuber'a que tira el agua hacia el cuerpo

Really great way to keep yourself clean, wish I would if purchased one years ago.

I scored it low for temp control because it is non heated water, which I knew prior to ordering. It works just great and does what it says it will do. Great buy for the cost

So, to be brief I'll skip over the cool things we liked about the Luxe bidet.  This review is regarding the little spray nozzle that drops down and squirts the fresh water onto ones nether regions.  Approximately 15 months after installation the squirter nozzle occasionally would not retract back to behind the protective guard door.  Now the nozzle refuses to retract at all, until we give it a gentle tap with the toilet brush, each time.  This is also bothersome because the nozzle can get dirty easily.  I called Luxe customer service and was told to clean it with vinegar, which was done, but the problem still exists.  I have since cleaned using an old toothbrush and bathroom cleaners.  The problem persists.  Luxe said this part is not repairable or replaceable.  I read this could be a manufacture's design failure, which will not be corrected by any cleaning process.  No longer happy with my Luxe Bidet 120.

I have now purchased this for all the restrooms, easy to setup use and maintain.

Let's just say there's an 88 year old woman out there who no longer gets the UTIs she used to. Correlation? Maybe. But she's totally convinced its because of this.

Dare I call it: R2-De-Poo?Yes. Yes I do. I had purchased a cheaper bidet a week ago and was very disappointed in it. I got more water on the back of my legs that anywhere else.So......Nope.So, I ordered this one around 9AM today and it was delivered at 5PM. How kick ass is that?!Easy install, Teflon tape is your friend and don't over tighten.I did giggle at the plastic wrenches. Although, that is really thoughtful of them. I get a feeling that this a pretty dope company. 80K great reviews says something too.Any-loo.This bidet has much better aim. I have to agree with the peeps that advise not to go past the low setting. I'm just going to leave it at that.Would it be weird to give one for the holidays? Part prank, part suggestion?Here's your Butt Fountain ? Happy Holidays !

It does not work. My daughter has this brand and it is fabulous. I was disappointed

I can not believe it took me this long to realize how useful a bidet would be! It's a method of hygiene used by other cultures through out the world. Better late than never!

Very easy to install and very reliable. It has held up so far with no issues!

I don't know how I ever survived without a bidet before now. I feel so clean and fresh. Didn't get one with the warm water option, but I leave the toilet seat open and the water is room temperature. I'll never NOT have this in my bathroom again.

It took my husband who he is by the way very handy to install things, at least 2 days. Having issues with the seat staying up. Had to contact customer service, they were very helpful, and after sending some necessary stickers on the seat was able to complete the installation.

Seen one of these in my son's master bath. I asked him about it and he gave it rave reviews. He said the 1st one they bought a couple years ago was a heated model but when the heater died they kept using it and found out they didn't really need the heat and bought this unit when the old one finally failed. My only regret is that I didn't buy this thing sooner. Excellent product and easy to install. Probably the best $40 I've spent in a long time.

This is probably one of the most important products I've bought.  Unfortunately, my first starting loosing pressure after two years and finally died after three years.  Started to leak out of the bottom.  Ended up buying another of the same model.  Would get 6 stars if lasted longer.

Bidet is affordable but it didn't work with my toilet. I added the bumpers still doesn't work. There isn't enough depth for the sprayer to open fully. So unfortunately going in the garbage.

It's a bidet. It does its job. It saves a bunch on TP. The one problem I will say is that the power control on the spray is a little finicky. It feels like a level 1 is barely a trickle but a level 2 is the almighty power of Poseidon shoving it where the sun don't shine.

First off- paid a professional plumber to install, because we have old copper lines and a very tight space. The bidet came with the water line and the T joint, so it's unnecessary to buy separate ones. It's basic, water temperature is what is in the lines.Pros: as a woman, especially if you've had children and suffer hemorrhoids, this feels SO MUCH BETTER than dragging paper over sensitive bits. The water stream goes where it's supposed to, and if you want to rinse your front off for that monthly time or after sex, just scoot back a bit. Much cleaner and you feel so much fresher than wiping with paper. Lack of warm water doesn't bother me, actually feels refreshing.Cons: the little door that protects the nozzle is a bit flimsy, and it got stuck in the down position. The door protects it when you clean the bowl, and change the direction of the spray to wash out the nozzle. Hopefully it holds up over time.Overall, I love it.

Had my Luxe installed on my 5th wheel toilet and I LOVE it!!! Second Luxe bidet I've had, wouldn't want to live without it!!!

Purchased beginning umpteen years ago.  Wifey got  a bath remodel and I bought her another Luxe Bidet.We have four bathrooms and every one has a Luxe Bidet.  Friends and family always ask about it.What's not to like.  The price is right, they are a snap to install (even easier to replace).  And the best part, our septic tank REALLY likes the idea of NO toilet paper.

It was extremely hard to setup. Teflon tape was provided but the instructions didn't include what to do with the tape. After spending a lot of time attempting to set it up we figured out it didn't fit our toilet. Sending it back.

Was a gift

Wow works great! My wife and I are both happy!  New bathroom buddy ??!

This is our second LUXE bidet.  Recommended by family members.  Took 5 minutes to install.

So easy to install, less than 5 minutes. Works perfectly!

This thing is great. I wish I had bought one years ago! Really easy to install

Don't buy it it didn't last a year and not it's broken not worth it

Saves on TP, bought it for my RV, works great, need to buy another one for my home

This really works.  Keep it clean!

We are very satisfied with this company and the service they provided us when we had an issue. Recommended highly

This was supper easy to install and really gets you clean. I don't recommend full blast! When I clean the toilets, I do have to clean it some but not a whole lot. I would love if it was actually temperature controlled, so it's not always freezing but other than that it's really good!

I've never used one before I got this. everyone everyone needs to try this.  it is the best thing ever. I hardly ever used toilet paper anymore. I love that there's several settings from soft to harder. And thand that it's a self cleaning 1 which is amazing perit's amazing. Everyone needs to go out and get this.

The bidet itself is wonderful.  However you have to pay extra for the risers to give the toilet seat itself some support. I've tried E6000, super glue and some other heavy duty glue and they just don't stick.  Very disappointing.

If you order the LUXE Bidet Neo 120 you will get only cold water - be sure to get one with warm water.  Easy to install but don't use it because the water is always too cold for my bottom.

AN AMAZING BREAKTHROUGH IN A TOPIC NOT OFTEN DISCUSSED. FOR ONCE I AM ACTUALLY CLEAN AND I LOVE IT! WILL PAY FOR ITSELF IN MONTHS IN REDUCED PAPER NEEDS. GREAT QUALITY AND WELL MSDE. I AM 68 YRS OLD AND INSTALLED IT IN UNDER 15 MINUTES. SO GLAD A BOUGHT ONE DURING THE TP CRISIS. I KNOW HAVE 3 IN MY HOME!

This is a good product except if you have a round toilet as opposed to elongated.  The ad doesn't mention this unless I missed something.  You would need to cut a notch in the toilet seat so it will lay flat.  Or you can buy the luxe toilet seat for $50.00.  I used a moto tool to grind out the notch.

It's good but the pressure is a little much, even on the lowest setting

This is a good idea, I've sold it to my customers and have one on my toilet, put's a smile on my face every morning.

If it sprayed forward and back it would be really helpful!

First purchased this model five years ago. I am just now replacing it with a new one, even though it is still working great. They do get scuzzy over time, and I just did not feel like soaking it in a bleach bucket and scrubbing it today like I usually do. They are so cheap that is doable, and it will come with free 2 hour delivery, as I am a Prime member. You should know that, although it has a nozzle cleaning function for daily use, you will want to install it under an easy clean toilet seat, so it is quick and easy when you do your deep-cleaning of the bathroom. As a female that has been plagued with periodic bladder infections for most of my life, I can tell you that it is a game changer for me that I have not had a single infection since I got this bidet fixture. And, as a prepper, I love that I haven't had to touch the hoard of toilet paper I put away in 2010. I have my own stash of microfiber drying cloths that just get thrown in with the rest of the laundry. Best purchase I have ever made.Edit:  I didn't realize they made them, but you can buy the Luxe toilet seat to go with the bidet fixture. Just installed it....has a clean, sleek look. If I have any issues with it, I will update. (TS1008R for my round toilet.

Purchased this for my parents. This has been helpful for BOTH and wanted to share they would recommend this for others.

Product works well. I had to go back to my old toilet seats "American Standard to make it work.Customer Service said they would send me a link to send them photos. They never did.Submitted photo's to Customer Service without the link. Never heard from them.Just figure it out yourself!

nice

Less then 5 min to install and works perfectly

Ohh I love this bidet. Easy to install and gives luxury bathroom at an affordable price

I bought my first bidet during the pandemic when there was a toilet paper shortage. I was hesitant about buying it at first, but I took a leap of faith and got one. When it arrived, I was amazed at how easy it was to install. It only took me about 15 minutes. When it came time to use it, it felt weird at first, but not as bad as I had anticipated. But I was shocked at how good it worked. After my first spray, I used toilet paper to pat dry and it was totally clear afterwards. Not even a speck of "residue" was on the paper. It's been almost 3 years and I've been using it ever since. It's one of the best investments I've ever made. Not only does it drastically reduce my need for TP, it also gets me 100 times cleaner. Once you're used to it, you'll never go back to wiping with dry TP again. I would highly recommend this product. You won't regret it.

Garbage is the only word I cam Describe this item First it leaked and the bidet part worked some times

For the price pint, this is an amazing product.  We started with one (at our grown kids suggestion), and now have on most all of our toilets, including our "public" ones.  It is surprising that although this product does not have a heater, the water is not all that cold, even in the winter.  One hint for installation - go outside the box on the directions - given that most bathrooms offer a ridiculous amount of space in the toilet area, go ahead and wrap the plumber's tape and attach the hoses (all but the hose to the bidet) before installing the seat.  Hint #2 is that if you have a rigid plastic hose from your water input to the toilet, replace that with a longer braided hose before you begin installation.  The distance for this hoses will be shortened by about 3", so if you don't have a longer length, it will not allow for the curves necessary for the installation.

I'd give this bidet a 5 star rating but for the weak control knobs.They don't last.

We purchased one and loved it so much that we ordered another one.  This is a great product and well work purchasing.

Do you want a cleaner, more comfortable butt? These are great.We've had one for 5 years in our master bath. It outlasted the more expensive one in our guest bath, so we replaced that with another one of these.I guess the main downside is that it's harder to clean the inside of your toilet bowl just behind the nozzle. It's warm and humid here, so mildew is a problem. Just takes extra work.Overall it's great.

ok product

I replaced a very expensive one with this one and am so impressed by the quality

Excellent quality

This product works great for the price! It gets the job done.

It was relatively easy to install even for an obese, stiff 73 yr old. I'm glad I got it. Pressure depends on your local supply. Round toilet bowls are a challenge to mount back far enough to be aimed right. Elongated toilets would seem ideal. Water temp is what's fed to the toilet so cool - cold.

I was skeptical and it sounded a little weird to me, but after 70+ years of wiping and smearing my behind, I thought seriously about getting a bidet. Then I stayed with my sister and she had one so I got to try it out without anyone knowing. So I played with it enough that I ordered one. I had a little trouble installing it, because I cross-threaded a fitting, but I got 'er done. Now I love having the cleanest rear I've ever had and am using half of the TP I used to use... mainly to dry off. I now never get 'it' on my fingers and feel very clean after each use. I wish I would have had this years ago.

Works great! Easy to install. Do not want my home without at least one!

This product is just as expected awesome

Am I writing this review as I bidet? Yes. Do I recommend this to everyone I literally know? Yes. 2 friends have purchased so far and all agree that it has dramatically improved their number 2's. BUY IT.

I love this thing!

Installation was super straight forward and simple, even as someone who is not great at following instructions. I had to replace and buy a separate the water tank supply line,  so that was the only hold up. It works just as advertised, the stream of water is super strong and tou can adjust the water pressure. Great value overall

I like it is good product

=Had to buy a luxe seat=Plastic mounting nuts pulled out the first try closing the lid=Instruction pictures are quite vauge=Will update once it is installed=So far its been 3 days of waiting on parts and now another day having to buy proper hardware

The first bidet we bought was in 2019 same LUXE model. 2021 The knob broke couldn't find one at any hardware store so called LUXE they overnighted the part. Stand up company! That's why we bought another just like the first one for the guest bathroom. One thing I have to say it's a cleaner feeling and the amount of toilet paper I saved is astounding, only way we made it thru the high cost thru Co-vid 19. Please give this company a try and also register within 30days of purchase you'll get an additional 6mos on the already 18month warranty and 5 bucks of your next purchase. Easy install, no additional parts to buy.

Home toilet room use my 2nd buy

good

facking great i've had it for awhile and it's never had any problems

the toilet seat doesn't close down all the way after this bidet is installed. Other reviews say to get bumpers but that then keeps an open gap in your toilet seat that is not ideal. I would shop elsewhere for one that will allow the toilet seat to sit flush still after installation.

0 quality had to upscale

Simple, easy to install, does the job.  I have these in every bathroom in the house.  Can't beat the price

The unit was easy to install and the controls work fine. The angle of the spray was off and did not wash my bottom properly. I bought the recommended bumper pads for the seat but the angle ws still off.

Easy to install, works great.

I had never used one before but it was on sale and I was not looking forward to buying another large package of TP at current prices. Easy to install, good quality parts and price was VERY reasonable, mine did not have a hot water hook-up (you don't need it). To my surprise it worked very well, I plan to install it in 2 other toilets. One of my better purchases this year saves money too. You do not know what you are missing until you try one. Go for it.

This is the greatest purchase of the year. I'm so much cleaner now that I use it. Even though it doesn't have temperature control, I've always found the temperature to be pleasant.

Simple to install works great keeps back side clean

This  is  great.. I never  had or used one and  it def is one of my favorite purchases !! Very  easy to install took about a half hour ..  the settinhs  are very useful .. good  quality  .. def  give it a try!!

I am so impressed with the quality for the money, installed very easily and does what it's supposed to do, wish we would've bought this year's agoI would recommend this to everyone!

I love to this bidet. I gave 4 star only because it only have 1 nozzle and its very difficult to clean front as being girl I would appreciate if it have different nozzle for front and back

I had to return this bidet since my original toilet seat would not sit flat I tried using spacers but the water would just blow through the space between the toilet and the toilet seat. I found the brondell brand and it was pretty cheap and comes with the toilet seat too. If it does work with your toilet seat though it's a great bidet and I highly recommend it.

i fully cut my hands trying to install this because no matter how tight i thought it was it was never tight enough. turns out the problem was i simply needed a few layers of plumbers tape around my toilet's water connector thingy. no leaks since! the roll they give you with it is very small but i did grab a cheap 6 pack that did the trick for only $5. very comparable to tushy which is what i switched from!

Included manual was very helpful and seems to cover almost any compatibility issue one may have. It claims they will send additional needed parts for free, with the exception of the part I needed - a flexible water pipe to replace the rigid one that came installed in my toilet - which was available at Home Depot for about $10. Although I have never worked on plumbing before, the instructions were clear enough for me to be confident installing the hose and bidet, and I have not had any leaks.Relies on your home's water pressure and cold water temperature, both of which I have found to be suitable. Glad to have this.

luxe is hands down the best brand for bidet attachments. i have tried 4 others & this was definitely the best experience i've had. Everything is easy to put together ( as easy as it can get with plumbing ) & easy to use.

I'm no expert at plumbing and I installed this with minimal cursing (only when I disconnected the water and it ran all over the floor) and only one tool in addition to those provided (a screwdriver). Works great!

I've never had a bidet at home and I didn't want to spend a lot to find out if I liked one or not. This was simple and quick to install. Everything needed for installation was included. More variety in the spray settings would be good, but at this price, this is what you get. I'll be ready to upgrade now that I know what to expect.

No Media

Once you install this item and start using it, you will find it difficult not to have it. It is a very comfortable experience and one I would recommend on every toilet in your home.

Awesome

Not sure how I ever managed without this.

Ok. Let's be honest, this is a personal thing, and it's embarrassing, however I am simply going to say this: if you have a condition that may cause intense bleeding from using traditional methods, buy this now. We didn't know if it would really help our daughter. It helped first time. We bought this second one when she was going away for a bit and knew she would need one. Installation was easier the second time, though I shall say buying the seat that is suggested helps. The first one fits well with this brands seat. It fits with the other generic brand, but the little water-jet-housing is not as snuggly hidden.

excellent.  thank you

This is one of a kind product. I love how humans are creative

We've only had this for a couple of weeks, but the installation was easy, the product functions great and overall we are very happy.

Item was bought around a month back and still running strong. It's a very convenient product with a nice price tag.

Easy to install, but pressure at my house was too high so had to buy a pressure reducer valve from lux for $12.  Otherwise works well.

leaves ur bum feeling great everytime however it may be a bit harsh for some

I have to say I didn't know what to expect when buying a bidet. I bought it for medical reasons because I broke my back and I can't twist or bend to wipe myself. That being said, I love this bidet and will continue to use it even after I heal. Would buy again absolutely.

Have you ever purchased a product and it worked better than you imagined.  If yes, then that result would be fitting of this product.This bidet is super easy to install and simply works ... amazingly well.I ended up getting another one.

The Luxe bidet is wonderful !  I wish I knew about this bidet attachment to your existing toilet years ago. And it saves on toilet tissure purchases. A great product. Very satisfied.

Love this! We miss the bidet every time we travel now! I would love it if it was easier to clean around the edge of where the cover pops open and behind the unit inside the toilet.

Easy setup.

Love this thing! Worth the money

Well engineered, featured, understandable instruction manuals, beautiful packaging, and the attention to detail and product workmanship is the highest I've ever seen in my life, and I'm 72 years old : ) I can see the company is customer orientated and takes pride in it's product. They even include tools to install, protectors on threads to prevent damage,  plumbers tape, metal hoses to prevent future water leakage, plastic nuts on water supply hose to ease in installing the bidet.  You can't go wrong purchasing this bidet!!!

So easy to install. Simple to operate. I've had it for a couple months and still happy that I bought it!

Gets the job done.  I wish it came with new bolts to attach with the seat, as you'll need longer ones now.

It's not working properly.

Easy to install

Easy to install, easy to use.  It's only cold water, but even in the winter it's not bad.  Toilet paper use is so much less!

Feels so much cleaner after using the toilet!

Don't think about it. Order this now!!!

First off I just want to say this was a simple install. The ONLY problem I had was a small leak when I first installed it. Wasn't a problem with the bidet system, but I just needed to get a new water valve which was just a $6 fix (the part that came with the house was super old). As soon as I put the part on it worked like a charm. Pressure was excellent. This was my first bidet experience and as a guy the first time shocked the hell out of me lol. All in all great product

Good product. Ready to install and operate. Gets things clean. The seat you use may impact its effectiveness, as low seats can make it hard for the shield to open. Overall, great to have.

I have had this product for 10 years and I love it. Now, after ten years it is leaking... WTF. I mean I was expecting 11 years out of this product and I only got 10 years. Whoops..... I just looked at the bottom installation date I did get 11 years. Sorry, forget this review....I got only 11 years of use out of this product and now it is beginning to leak..........

This is a game changer! You can control the pressure to whatever works for you. The only thing that I dislike about this bidet was it made the toilet seat higher that there is a gap between the toilet and the toilet seat so you have to buy those raisers so you don't end up squashing the base of the bidet.

Incredibly easy to install and of high quality.  I would buy it again over all others. It even came with tools.

It'll break your toilet seat. So you contact them and they tell you the 6 seats that work with the bidet. So then you buy the new seat, and it still has a gap. Wtf. Total waste of money. Never again.

This is the crown to my porcine thrown

Easy to install and works very well.  Much more sanitary than just ordinary and 'dry' toilet paper.

BOY HOWDY DO YOU NEED TO CONVERT TO THE CHURCH OF WOOTER BUTT. THIS IS A LIFE CHANGING EXPERIENCE AND I JUDGE EVERY SINGLE INDIVIDUAL WHO REFUSES TO CONVERT. CRANK THAT DIAL AND EXPUNGE THAT EVIL FROM YOUR BUM. NEVER AGAIN WILL YOU FEAR OF ACCIDENTALLY GETTING SOME BUTT MUD ON THOSE GORGEOUS FINGERS OF YOURS. BUY A BIDET TODAY AND UNLOCK YOUR THIRD EYE.

Leaves a little gap between the seat and the toilet but I love how easily it is to use and how simple it was to install.

Worth it

This product does it's job. Low star on temp control because I didn't get the temp control one. 2 stars on softness but that isn't so much the products fault. Be warned if you have powerful water pressure you will know when you use this, I have extremely powerful pressure and when I turned it on the first couple of times it scared the crap out of me so ease into it slowly turning it on.

Bidet took less than half an hour to install. Biggest issue was not with product but rusty bolt from the existing toilet seat. I just brushed it and put some teflon lubrication/anti rust liquid on it. Bidet operation is simple. Just wiggle on the seat until it hits the spot. I expect it to pay for itself y substantially cutting down in toilet paper use. I just ordered another one for the other bathroom.

This product is good but it used to come with PVC T connection now is not there and the metal one always leaks ' not sure if this was a mistake in the order I received or they decided not to include the PVC in the kit

It leaves a big gap between the toilet seat and toilet.

There is no better feeling than a clean b*** hole!! And this does the job!

He used to have a freestanding bidet this works absolutely fabulous I can't even noticed the difference between the two but do get the toilet seat it's very sturdy and it doesn't work well without it

Very reasonably priced and works great.  I installed it in about 30 minutes.  Very clean feeling!

Really wanted a bidet. Was easy to install..does the job well. Wish had a temp controll but for the price point it's okay.

best bidet you'll find for this price range.

entrega r'pida Y buen Producto

...of the never-ending wipe!I was so jolly when I got this installed!  The future looks bright! ??

Easy to install and use. Much better than using paper

This a great bidet. Excellent price and essential features for a low price. You can control the water strength for comfort. The self cleaning nozzle is a bonus. Simple install. This refers to the cold water version.

Product did not last long enough to justify a purchase. Quite working just after returning the product for a refund was possible

I installed this in a condo with lower water pressure and it was extremely gentle, but it keeps your buns clean and less toilet paper used so I'm not complaining. Installation is super easy if you have tools and a toilet that's not in a particularly cramped space.

I liked the bidet. Works well and easy to install

I've always wanted one and I didn't want the one that's like a shower head like my friends (middle eastern) have. This def. was worth the buy. I wish it had a temperature gauge b/c the cold water sometimes is a shock/surprise, but okay to deal with. I def. feel clean after this and I'm happy with the overall purchase.Pros:-Clean feeling-For me, easy install but took time as I needed to clean aroudn the area (older toilet was tighter than normal for this install)-Looks great-Use less tissue during the "go"-Don't need to shower afterwards on those messy "go's"Cons:-Wish there was a warmer option for the water-Seems to gush out quicker than I thought-Self cleaning, Not sure what that option is lol I use it to help alleviate the stream while the main nozzel is going.-Sometimes there is spray on the back of the toilet seat-Sometimes I have to move myself around to feel I got all of the area for cleaning purposes-Still have to use tissue to wipe down the wetness on the areaOverall, a great buy and I don't regret it.I rated this 4/5 for the above comments. I will update this product as I utilize it.

People started using a damp wipe in the last few years and that is killer on your plumbing. This device will save you a ton on toilet paper and gives you a very clean result. I had an older person ask me to install one and when I saw it was about $30 I figured I'd try one myself and see how easy it is to put in. It is very easy. Easy enough my son installed it before I even got home. You just pop off the toilet seat and put this down and screw your seat on top. Then just connect the water hose to the line already at the base of your toilet. I've heard people say they are great but then when you own one you get it. Your own bathroom is always better than somewhere else but after you put this in you really won't want to conduct your business anywhere else. It's easy to clean. It maybe adds a min to my bathroom cleaning. Totally worth it

how the hell do i get it to hit my butt. its not a stream its water covering mthe whole expans with no water pressure. i used a bidet for 5 years with no problem with watter pressure. the only reasson i switched it out was the hosde in the old one developed  a leak so i thought id just buy a new one. unfortunately i could not buy the old one anymore so i ended up with this piece of junk.i had to pay to put it in now take it out and sent it back and put it back. so i thinl i will see if i can put the old one in. there is not a single thing for sale these days that care about quality control.all the crap items that are sold need to be given to the people who okay these things for sal and that is what they have to use

excellent all around - for the price and quality this is a homerun! Life changing even!

I use this product for personal hygiene. The settings are easy to use. It's very elegant looking. I'm very happy with my purchase.

I knew that in buying a Bidet, It'd leave me cleaner. I didn't expect that it'd be such a thorough storm of water that gets the job done! I definitely won't need any TP soon. Highly recommend because I've never felt so clean and can't go to the bathroom without it. A game changer!

The pressure is a bit high on the lowest setting, would prefer it had more adjustment capabilities.

Just hard to clean around.

Great product!

The unit was easy to install and although I was skeptical I really like having it. This model does not have temperature control and I was worried about that. However after using this for a year I havn't seen the need for a heated unit (perhaps if you live in a northern climate?)

You need this.

Great

Installed on a Kohler Highline Elongated toilet in Oct. 2022.  I purchased the Alpha bidet with continuous warm water, heated seat, night light, odor fighter, and remote control for our first bidet adventure and all the whistles and bells are nice.  But you can easily get by without them. I thought I would save $500 and try a highly rated $30 bidet.  The $30 Luxe bidet is the smart alternative and it's easy to install.  I'm ready for the next toilet paper shortage (ha).

Works well and nice looking.

Fairly easy installation. Make sure you have a flexible water supply line. Definitely worth the money, but it does lack some features like drying. Overall, I recommend

This works great and looks and feels much better than the previous 'sprayer hose' style I had. Took about 20 min to install and works great. I would definitely recommend.

It's a snap to install and does the job well.  The lack of a temperature control was not an issue for us. Although a dryer would be nice, it certainly can't be expected on a low-priced unit.

it was easy to install and the water pressure works amazing, but when i turn on the nozzle clean, nothing happens, its not even cleaning itself?

Love this product! Gets the posterior clean!

I bought this one because my sone had it and was happy with it.Unfortunately, there are no spacers, included with this item, to accommodate added plate thickness between the toilet and toilet seat. As the result, toilet seat will break, due to raised back part of it. Son's bidet had spacers included. Apparently, NOW, you have to buy them separately. So no, return.Otherwise, it's probably a great item, except that they are cheap enough not to include spacers anymore.

If you come from India just like i do the you will understand the importance of this product, you will love this bidet, reasonably priced and it does the work its intended to do very well.

How did I ever live without it.?!

This is a fairly cheap bidet, it has no temperature control, and the pressure may be a bit hard, but it's easy to install and works well. It's nice and simple, and a good bidet if you're not picky. Overall, I would recommend this product.

This is the fifth one I have purchased over the years, great product, I buy a new one every year to year and a half just for sanitary purposes, never had any issues until this one, but I still rate this as a great product.  There is a metal screw on bolt that screws into a plastic fitting on the setting module. I was very careful not to cross thread it but the plastic was so soft that I did not feel it tighten at all and it just started spinning. I will contact customer service I'm sure they will take care of it, my suggestion is when you're doing the fitting that screws onto the control module hand screw it a couple turns, then slightly turn the water on to see if it's on tight enough yet, if it's not then tighten another turn or two and check the water again, so you don't over tighten it, this is what I will do with my replacement I hope I get.  Thank you overall great product, I have two autistic children and I will not use a regular toilet ever again!

Wasn't that sure what to expect when I bought it.  I was having some itching in my posterior and it  was recommended.  Well 2 months later, the itching is gone.  It's easy to use and easy to clean.  installation was also very easy.  Getting used to the cold/room temperature water spray is probably the toughest thing.  I don't think you save much toilet paper, since it is still needed to insure cleanliness and drying up.  I don't know how I ever lived without it.

Best thing since sliced bread. Makes going to the bathroom enjoyable. You can adjust the intensity of the sprayer and my husband said it was very easy to install.

Easy to install. But I hope material to be better.

Easy to install and works great leaves you feeling clean

Had my boyfriend install (who's a handyman, but even if you aren't handy I believe it shouldn't be to hard to install) didn't take him too long. I waited till I had to go to the bathroom to use it and when I tried it for the first time in low' CHILEEE, it bout blew me off the toilet seat, in the best way possible. I've only had it for a day and I already don't wanna go back. I love it has a self cleaning feature as well!

Great product fairly easy install with the right tools and fittings.  The install depends on a couple things. One, your original supply line fits the adapter and the toilet shutoff works. Two, the supply line length is not to long, I installed two and needed shorter lines for both. $8.00 Home Depot each. Everyone loves these things and they'll pay for themselves in toilet paper savings.

The fittings were wrong for New Zealand.  I had to get a plumber in to fit it in the end.  Need the gap fillers on the toliet set for it to work.  Still waiting for mine to arrive.  It seems to be taking a long time.

If you're on the fence about this like I was, let me just tell you# 1 - it was SO EASY to install- I found helpful videos on YouTube too.# 2 YOU'LL SAVE TOILET PAPER!!! That's an INVESTMENT in my eyes.# 3 LADIES - I recommend getting the one that can clean up front' wish I had, I'll buy that one soon and put this one in my boys bathroom.

I haven't gone through the numbers but the upfront cost of toilet paper alone will be reduced 90 per cent.It is much quicker to simply turn a dial and be sprayed off and then dry yourself with a bit of paper than to wipe wipe wipe wipe with paper. It was positively surprising to see that the paper used to dry myself was wet only; no other stain.

This is for the women - I got this while pregnant to help wipe, however continued to get Uti's/yeast infections and didn't realize why. Then I discovered before I got this I never had one (got rid of it and haven't had one since). The issue of this device is you have to move forward or to the side to get an accurate spray on your bottom. However, I feel the water can mess up your natural PH and or shift fecal matter forward-all of which can be disastrous. So it's a good concept but not if you have sensitive lady parts.

This bidet seems much more sturdy than the last one (which ont lasted a month before it started to break). I like that the water pressure is adjustable for those times when you don't feel the need for a mini enema. ;)

Bought these back in 2020, can't imagine not using them!

We have Toto drake toilets with a shallow bowl. The nozzle on this bidet hits it while extending making it unusable. The product seems high quality and thoughtfully designed though.

This bidet looks good and works okay, but there is a problem. If you have decent water pressure at your house, the stream is way too strong. Product description says pressure is adjustable, and it is, from high to very high. You have to buy a cutoff valve, and it has to be a Luxe valve or it won't fit. That adds considerably to the cost. I bought a different on and am much more pleased.

Saving us a bunch of TP and works as described. We def have more pep in our step with clean bottoms all around.

Second one of these I've bought. I've never been cleaner, not gonna lie. Jet's quite powerful, a little difficult to regulate, but, living in a house with low water pressure, much better than another brand I tried which was much too weak.

Every household should have a Bidet installed in all the bathrooms.  It is very hygienic and hands free way to clean your butt.  It is like a touchless carwash :-).  If you want to get fancy you can buy the more expensive models that warms up the water which is useful in winter.  I have installed the basic Bidet in all the bathrooms and have been using it for the past several years.  Of all the different items I purchased in my life, this was the best ROI (Return on Investment).  Highly recommend if you want a hygienic touchless butt wash.

Love it all. Don't expect an eye rolling into the skull experience though.

Very easy to install.Great addition to my toilet.

PROS: Very easy to install. Had mine in and done within 10 minutes. Strong spray, very nice. Seems to be well constructed with firm controls.CONS: Apparently, the internal water line runs through the part that installs under the toilet seat mounting bracket, so when I try to use it, it won't spray until I lift myself up a bit. Very annoying. Also, the protective cover has a weak snap catch that constantly pops the door open a little.All in all, it's a good buy, would be even better if the manufacturer would fix the above issues.

Easy to install ! Easy to use our third !

I have very mixed feelings about this product, I had no issue with installation, had no need for seat raisers, and the water temp is doable. HOWEVER i can't for the life of me get the angle correct even if I move to accommodate it I get covered in water and or my seat gets covered in water from the spray back. Now my hope is to eventually figure something out to fix this but in the mean time the one thing i cant work around is using a plunger, it just doesn't fit and when i tried i almost broke the bidet because its in the way.

This was returned

Easy to install after I watched a video on YouTube. Reading the instructions kinda confused me lol but it took 10 minutes to figure out and it works great. Only thing that isn't great is it only works with my cold water wish it was heated a little but it's fine

I recently had back surgery on my L4 L5 and can't Bend, Lift or Twist. I bought this to prevent blt's and I should of bought one long before my surgery for use. Such a great amenity plus I use TP about 75% less. No more tp shortages.

This item is exactly what I needed. I have always thought there should be some form of water used to clean up after going number two. Wipes usually have leave my bottom feeling a certain way.You will have to adjust your rear sometime to get a good clean, but I have bought and installed one in each of my bathrooms. I love it and am pleased with my purchase. There is no temp control on this model, but it doesn't matter much when cleaning to me.Watch the water pressure, and crank slowly.

Amazing product. Perfect positioning, not too harsh of a water stream. Everyone needs a bidet.

I was afraid that a cold water jet aimed at my butt would be shocking. I'm happy to report that the stream is not too cold and the mechanism works nicely. I do find if I sit too far back on the toilet, my weight keeps the spigot from deploying. Leaning forward makes it work.

Will never own a toilet without a bidet again! Only issue was that you need the same brand toilet seat as bidet or it won't mount. Otherwise I couldn't recommend enough.

inexpensive and easy to install.

Great product and worth the money. Super easy instalation, I didn't believe the advertised instructions but they are true. It took no more than 10 mins to install.

I don't see how people live without a bidet. This product has worked so beautifully and when we travel,  this is what we miss the most.  It saves so much money in toilet paper,  too.

Was hesitant to even purchase such a thing.  After months of neighbors, friends etc telling me how great this thing is.  I finally purchase it!  It came and in minutes had the thing installed and operating.  To my surprise, it worked better than I could have ever imagined.  Still a bit embarrassed to use it and talk about it, I'm slowly coming to grips with it and the wonders of it.  The water is room temp and not a cold burst as I thought it would have been.  The pressure is, well, be careful to start off slow.  The cleanliness after using  is beyond my wildest expectations.  I'm more than impressed.  I would highly recommend this product.  Btw although I don't have this issue right now,  it might be a life saver for those going for a colonoscopy since you'll spend a lot of time on the pot and not have to wipe making your rear end sore and raw from wiping so much.  It may also help people with hemorrhoids to stay clean and fresh down there on a low pressure setting.

Yes, I would like it how many months I want to be Amazon prime because that's right he doesn't work

Easy to install works great.. Seems high quality would buy again.

I'm handy with my tools, so mid renovation my wife and I decided to try out a bidet for kicks. After reading through oodles of reviews I decided to try this guy out. It literally took me ten minutes to install. The one review about tweaking the dial between "self cleaning and booty clean" helped guide my initial experience. Once I was comfortable, (I laughed on my first go round??) I just played with the pressure til I was satisfied. No issues with the install, everything was included except the seat risers, which I can live without. Thanks all for the help, and hope this helps someone else.

It was supper easy to install and works great !

Goodness, what a miracle it would have been to have this marvelous bidet back during my younger days, when I was having periods every month. This thing is amazing, you will not regret buying it, I assure you. I've purchased them as gifts for my female family members and they are flabbergasted at how life is improved with your own bidet! Unbelievably easy to install and as for the water temperature, I didn't hook mine up to the hot water line, I just have cold water washing the "down below parts" and it's still great. Refreshing as a matter of fact! Even the men use it because it does wash the front and the back end.

Once you use a bidet you cannot go back to not using one, and you think that you should've been using one a long time ago. Very easy to install and hookup to the toilet. Very good pressure, knows exactly where to aim! The temperature (at least for me) is one option so I'm not sure if that's a toilet thing or bidet thing. But great great product and great price. Your tush will thank you

Dry easy to install, perhaps the pressure does not come up gradually, it's easier to lower from a higher pressure than to raise from 0 gradually. Everything else works perfectly. I would recommend

It's too thick and still need to buy the $15 bumpers ????

Very easy to install, the pressure on it was high but not bad at all, does exactly what you want it to do

This is an excellent way to feel squeaky clean after using the restroom. Just make sure to start slow; our last apartment had low water pressure so we had to crank it, but when we moved the pressure was MUCH higher. Almost blasted off my bits!

I bought this at $35 and has easily been one of the best investments I've made. It helps to cut down on toilet paper, you feel cleaner than ever, and you get to pretend to be better than everyone else for having a bidet! (just only kind of kidding :P)I have a Tushy bidet in my master bathroom and this one in my upstairs bathroom, and honestly, I kind of prefer this one. The spray doesn't seem to be as harsh as Tushy's, but that may also be because I purchased a T adapter so that I could limit the flow of water which in turn causes it to spray less hard. Either way though, this has been a fantastic addition to the house and I would recommend every single person that can, gets a bidet to use.

Only gripe is that the height settings do not really increase the flow pressure. It still gets the job done but would have liked a little more oomph to it.For anyone worried about it being cold, it's like room temperature if not slightly cooler water. It's not going to make you jump in the air and scream in shock. You'll be fine and comfortable. You will also lament having to use a restroom without one instilled.

Installation was easier by connecting the plumbing first, but still fairly easy. Be careful to align the bidet evenly centered. Not sure how I lived without a bidet all these years. So much better than toilet paper. Wish I'd had this during the early days of COVID when toilet paper was impossible to find. I highly recommend this product. I've installed three at my home and two for friends.

What a big difference, works great

I have purchased three different brands at this price point and the LUXE was the easiest to install & the most efficient for a $30 bidet attachment. The other 2 were cheap, flimsy feeling, and leaked

Got this as an experiment. I actually love it now. It only takes about 5-10 minutes to install. I would really recommend this to postpartum moms!

So impressed, bought for a new bathroom addition for toilet.  You truly don't know how great it is until you use one!

I put off buying one of these for years because I thought using cold water would be uncomfortable. I was wrong. Room temperature tap water is not uncomfortable at all. There's no reason to spend $200 on a seat with a heating function that you'll have to run an extension cord from another room to use.Get this. You'll be cleaner, use less toilet paper and have less irritation.

It cleans well and has pretty easy to understand installation instructions that are easy to follow along with! I definitely have noticed a decrease in toilet paper and sanitary wipe purchases! Definitely recommend!

I bought 3 of these and I don't love them but I don't hate them either. I'm reviewing the first one , which I purchased about a year ago. I like that we reduced toilet paper usage in our household and also because of health related issues I am very sensitive down there , this product helps with that as well.Installation is suppose to be pretty straight forward but in my case our toilets were not installed with flexible hoses, instead they had a ones made out of PCV. These PCV lines do not bend to allow space to install the adapter that came with this kit. After purchasing flexible hoses the installation was smooth and completed within 20 minutes.Now for functionality, the bidet is pretty straight forward. Turn the knob and align yourself and done.  There are no extra features like nozzle adjustment, or temperature control etc...Turning the first knob from left to right adjusts the strength or power of the water coming out of the nozzle. Sometimes it's a little too strong even at the lowest settings but then again it might be because I'm extra sensitive. It has another knob for self cleaning , turning this knob all the way and then turning the strength knob shoots the water down and it self cleans. One thing to mention is that it does change the height of your toilet seat so purchasing the toilet seat bumpers is highly recommended.Compared in price to other expensive bidets I think you get a bidet that gets the job done and you don't have to break the bank. When I purchased this item it was 29.99 and after a year of use it still performs as intended .

Great bidet! It gets the job done. Idk if it's this bidet but the aim on this bidet is amazing. The shield also such a good detail that makes me feel extra clean.My "clean-itself" nozzle doesn't work though. Idk if I did anything wrong.

I never have felt cleaner after going to the restroom!!!

He said it was easy to install and he loves it

Not sure why I ordered a different brand for our second bathroom, but to save $5 it caused frustration and then we sent it back for a Luxe because we know it works!  We've had our original for over 5 years and it has zero issues. Cut back on TP purchasing tremendously, and the teenager no longer is clogging the potty.  I wish I had these all along.

Muy bueno

Does the job well but be forewarned - the initial spray is a lot stronger than anticipated.  It works well for my third trimester sized body and I'm looking forward to using it post-party.  However my children and husband are terrified of it.

If your looking for a piece to life's puzzle, purchase this'..you'll giggle with elation upon initial use

I dont know why I havent had one of these in the past - they are fantastic -- super easy to install

This product is easy to install and use.  I would recommend this for anyone who does not mind a little cold water... If you have the money to spare you might want to upgrade to heated water.

I've purchased 5 of these. Two for my home and 3 for family members. Owning one of these bidets is a life changer! Love em!!!

Love this and can't live without it!

Easy to install & use.

The product was easy to install. Only a screwdriver was needed to remove the seat to install the product. No tools were necessary to install the product itself. Liked the fact that a "wrench" to hookup the product was built in. Would recommend it to anyone wanting to install a bidet.

Amazing product

Difficult to put in parts broke

I use this product every time I use the restroom..

I thought it was easy to install. I ended up getting the spacers that go on uour seat. I bought 3 and will be buying more for my family.

Brilliant. So simple to install and exceeded expectations.

Super easy install. Entire family loves this bidet. Adult son with level 3 autism is toilet independent with this bidet. He could never wipe adequately. Now clean butts everywhere. Thank you Luxe ??

This is a great product for getting yourself, really clean. It installs very easy. That said, here's an installation tip, after shutting the water off & removing the supply line to the bottom of the tank, make sure to check the nut securing your flush valve inside the tank. They can loosen up in the process of removing the supply line. When I installed the bidet, plumbing, specifically the T-adapter, it allowed the loosened flush valve in the toilet tank to rotate, pushing the shut off float against the back of the tank. Consequently when I turned the water back on the stuck float didn't allow the water to shut off. I took the lid off the tank and discovered why the water was still running way longer than it should have. I rotated the valve away from the back which tightened it up, all is good 0 leaks. So for the money you just can beat this little set up. Everything you need is in the kit for installation. The only thing I would ask Luxe to throw in would be 2 of the toilet seat bumpers. The toilet lid & seat do slope a bit. I always place a bumper parallel right behind the originals on the toil seat. I know this was wordy, but I hope it is helpful to someone else.

I do not know why I waited so long to get a bidet! You feel so clean and fresh and just use a little toilet paper to pat dry. There is no temp control on this model, but honestly I don't mind it. It takes a little bit of getting used to. There really is also no water speed, it is really just on and off. It has a dial, but I personally do not notice the difference between the lowest and the highest speed. This was inexpensive, easy to install and works great. Totally worth what I paid. If you want one with lots of speeds and heated water, your going to have to pay for a more expensive model. For the price, this is perfect!

Have taken 3 to our 2 nd house

I bought 2 of these Neo 120's from Amazon and with 2 different brand toilets, now I need to spend more money to purchase toilet seat bumpers to raise the seat in order for them to work. I purchased 1 set of bumpers for $6.99 plus tax with free shipping from Amazon where I purchased the Bidet(s). (I still need another set of bumpers). When I registered, I got $5.00 off of a future purchase from Luxe but when I looked at your website, your bumpers were $9.99 plus tax and shipping which honestly is a joke. These bumpers cost you next to nothing and should included in every package - charge a little more if you need to.  If nothing else, you should warn people that they may need to purchase bumpers or tell them which toilets they work for that they wont need bumpers.

This was a great Brand.. it's sooooo nice.. hooked up in 5 min and worked instantly.. I love it!  It works perfect and I would never, never do without it!I bought the same one for my second bathroom and bought my Granddaughter married one also..  this is the best for teenagers and women with periods,You will love yourself everyday for getting this.. never, ever had water coming out that was too cold!!!Get it!!!!  This was a great buy, my best yet!My husband is so happy I bought this.. one of his favorite things now and says we couldn't live without it!!! I know I won't!

It's a dead aim! Works great!

So to set this review up, last year, my grandfather passed away from old age and in September of this year I moved into the house he spent the rest of his life in, practically until his dying day. As old a house as this one, I still expected to handle this house like you would any other house, but my mother warned me against flushing toilet paper in the toilet due to the septic tank not being able to handle toilet paper without cracking. Took me a few weeks to remember that Bidets exist so I started window shopping for ones, finally settling on a Bidet from Luxe.Installation worked like it was supposed to work, but after I finished installing the Bidet, it left a gap in the seat and when I sit down, it blocks the water from hitting the rear and I have to slightly get up in order for it to work. So unless you guys have cheaper recommendations, I'm probably gonna pay for the Luxe Bidet Seat and get my current one replaced.So long story short, I bought this bidet to save money from replacing a septic tank and probably some of you got friends making jokes at you about your bidet like mine have but I rather have the jokes than pay thousands of dollars to replace a tank.Update: Stupid me, I broke the nozzle guard so I may have to get it replaced, but I'm leaning towards not doing it because I don't know if the warranty covers it. If anybody has advice about that, let me know.

Lux Bidet was very easy to install. Took me only a few minutes. The hose feels like good quality. One week passed no leakages and works like a charm.

Material quality could be improved further.

For over a month I've wondered why I can't install this correctly and why it constantly leaks. I tried multiple solutions and nothing worked. Then reviewing people's review photos, I quickly realized that my package didn't come with a plastic adapter piece and that my toilet was leaking because of that piece. One missing piece makes this a terrible product and unusable

It sort of sticks out on the seat edge where your bottom would sit. Also, it has a lot of pressure even on the low end.

It's 2022 stop wiping and wiping to check if your clean, power wash those mufflers and fee refreshed. That spray on full blast will wake you up faster than Starbucks in the morning. Takes moments to instal and we'll worth it. Only downside is if you have this and a squatty potty you're never pooping in public again.

I bought this because of the positive reviews but the fact of the matter is there is just no water pressure and for that reason I will be returning

Works extremely well. You won't ever feel clean again when nature calls and you're not home. There's a reason the rest of the developed world uses a bidet '. If you're on the fence, just buy it. Installation is super quick, anyone can do it. The only thing you need to be able to do is shut the water off at the wall. The rest is quick and easy. These will change your life and make you feel clean and refreshed each time. Saves $$ on toilet paper too! Cold water is refreshing and doesn't bother you after you use it a couple of times.

I'm 59 and never used a bidet in my life til a few months ago. Love this! Quite the game changer. I have already bought 2 for friends. I wish I had grown up with one of these. More importantly, wish I had it 3 years ago during Hemorrhoid Harry. I will literally hold my bowels and use the special bathroom where this is installed. And grumpy BF likes it, too!!

I love it , it's all what I need

It's alright

If you're reading this, and open to the idea then go for it. Easy to install, only cold water so keep that in mind but it's fine, and your butt will never feel cleaner. You'll use less toilet paper, and never feel cleaner. You'll be annoyed when you're elsewhere and don't have the option to use this.

Sprayer door fell in toilet / broke within a week.

I purchase this due to a shoulder surgery. I thought I would only use it during my recovery period however I found I wouldn't want to be without. This is the only one I have ever used but this one works perfect and the guard in front of the spray nozzle is a must.

So far so good

My toilet seat has a slight curve on the bottom. This prevents the seat from sitting flat as it hits the bidet when closing. There is over an inch gap between lid and rim of the toilet bowl. Reading the reviews this is a super common issue, so a little warning in the product description would be nice.

Easy install, I love this thing

I had never used a bidet. When vacationing in Florida the condo we stayed in had this particular bidet. My wife and I started using it and really liked it. I just purchased and installed it today took me about 15 minutes. It fit perfect on my downstairs toilet. Seems to work fine and no leaks. I will try it for a couple months before I order 2 more. Should definitely save on toilet paper. I'm giving it 4 stars only because nothing is ever perfect.

After reading lots of reviews and the pros and the cons there's always some winners and some wingers lol'.ok we love this It was fairly easy to install we bought the adapter thingy the metal one after reading some of the reviews so the plastic one wouldn't wear out.The best part about it is feeling clean you can control the amount of pressure but it is ultimately down to your water pressure that your house has ,I found it comfortable at about halfway..Use Way less toilet paper And I can wave goodbye to wet wipes which probably aren't a good thing for septic tank even though the ones that we buy say they are.uses very little water And a lot less than having to flush the toilet a few times after lots of paper.

A bidet has become a must-have for me. I'm happy with this but the water pressure could be a little stronger.

It is helpful with personal cleanliness.

The bidet creates a big gap on the toilet seat, so that when a person sits down, it blocks the cover and stuck the nozzle. It also cost me money to buy the seat bumper, but it doesn't help neither

Love this bidet! I just wish we would have bought one sooner. Great product make well.

No temperature control, easy to install, good control of pressure

My rear end no longer smells like backside throughout the day. Definitely more sanitary than just paper.

Easy to install and works good. Instead of the easy clean feature which is basically useless I would prefer a dial to expand and contract the spray width. Wiggling around on the throne to get all angles is tiresome. All in all a good product and I recommend it. Your septic system and trees will thank you.

This product is easy to install and works great. $30 Wow

I still use TP but significantly less. When I go on vacation or when nature calls elsewhere I miss it! Well worth the price!!

Easy to installComes with everything you need except some spacers to raise your toilet seat half an inch

Easy to install, easy to use. Must have item.

I have purchased and returned 4 other brands. First, this unit comes completely sealed inside the box. The others came loosely wrapped ,not sealed , which gave me the impression they were returns. This is the one with the correct t adapter for my toilet inlet  and has an easy to tighten nut. This unit also comes with two plastic wrenches. It is awesome. So after I finger tightened everything I went back and tightened it with the plastic wrenches provided. I didn't have to try to find something that I'm not even sure if I have, as far as the correct wrench .This is the only one to buy. It's not heated but maybe I'll look for something later on that is. Very pleased with this quality bidet seat.

Looks really cute and works well. Just follow a YouTube video on how to install and you will have no problem!

Very easy to install this is the second one I purchased we love it never want to be with that one

works great

I was not able to install yet. Need some additional reducer to connect from our city water inlet line to tank and second line goes to bidet.

Very easy to install and to use. Good value

Love this bidet. It does the job, But Sometimes the spout gets stuck and we have to pull it out.

I purchased this product in 2019 and it functions fine. However, one of the plastic control knobs broke and I'm having trouble finding a replacement.If you want something cheap that works, this is a good product. But, if you want it to last you'll want to look into either replacement knobs or a bigger end version. I did not hook up hot water, so it's just cold water and isn't relevant to my rating.

I don't spend so much on toilet paper or baby wipes anymore! My cost on those went down drastically due to the bidet ??

This package installed easily and I liked that they included all the hardware and tools needed to install. It works well, and has a built in cleaning function that's a nice addition. So far I'm happy with my purchase.

The best product and so easy to install even my first time but it's took me only 10 minutes to be done. You'll definitely love it for your convenience.

Gave this bidet as a gift to a female. I don't know if this back-to-front spray bidet contributes to UTIs in females but since the use of this bidet lab, positive UTIs have gone way up. Could the back-to-front spray push contaminate from the rectum forward to the short urethra in females? They make a wand that sprays front to back.

we had to return becuase we needed a slim bidet. otherwise product works

I experienced a bidet on vacation recently and started looking for my own. After searching and researching, I found this one. After reading 'Edawg's' hilarious and honest review, I promptly purchased this. This is a LIFE CHANGING experience!! So easy to install (for singles). Customer service was excellent. Pair this with a Squatty Potty and you are truly the Queen/King of your Throne! ????

So easy to install and every  fit like it should And now it leaks into the toilet bowl  A constant small stream several flowing out of the bidet into the toilet bowl so I am going to return it since the situation

Initially it worked Good but now for past more than a month it isn't. I wish if i cud return now.

Mucha comodidad y  higiene ahorras en papel sanitario yo estoy muy contenta con el mio lo recomiendo mucho

It works properly

Use less toilet paper. Spray your b hole clean first.

What a great help for elders with limited body movement.Wish I'd  had this devise years ago.

Disclosure, my wife bought it but I installed it. I also used it once so felt I was qualified to review it. Installing it was pretty easy but not the most solid material. But for the price well worth it. I'm knocking off 1 star for a very important reason. This thing has no pressure control. You twist a knob to the lowest setting and you instantly turn around to see who just violated you from behind. I mean I was deep cleaned like from a fire hose. I also found that now I am legally married to the bidet in China and certain parts of the middle east. We're planning a honeymoon in the Caribbean.

Product was used.  Large pieces of retail packaging were cut off the box.  Multiple layers of cut tape just taped back over.  All the inside packaging had been shredded apart and thrown back in the box with the used bidet.

I was always curious about these and I am so happy I got this one. I had issues with my installation (mostly because of whoever installed my toilet and the way they installed it) BUT, the people at LUXE were amazing and extremely helpful in getting me the necessary equipment to complete my installation. I am extremely satisfied and fully recommend this product.

Love this item. Works great. Liked so much ordered another for my winter condo.

How did I live without one? My friend has one and was raving so I bought two and now my husband and I are so spoiled we wish we had them when we on trips! It took a min to get used to the cold water but feels so refreshing and wow I am saving tons from not using hardly any toilet paper! Definitely worth the money!

As a kiddo, I was always leery of a bidet; for the reason we all initially are. However, since COVID ( now 3 years and counting) we have all seen various shortages of toilet paper as well as the costs of goods skyrocket. Back in early March, I decided to take advantage of my remote working from home and went to go visit my best friend. He and his wife had these installed in every bathroom. My best friend, knowing me for so long, joked with me about going in and giving it a try. Well, I finally did and at first, I wasn't too keen on it. However, when I did return home, I started shopping around for a bidet addon for my home bathrooms. It all comes down to simple math: a) where I live I am not responsible for the water bill b) this is a fairly inexpensive add-on that literally pays for itself within a month or so of use and 3) its good for the environment... as you literally use 80%+ less toilet paper. This device has metal fittings, is easy to install and I use it daily. It has dramatically cut down on the amount of toilet paper I purchase monthly as well as dramatically reduced the amount of wasteful toilet paper usage in the household. I was skeptical at first and not particularly keen on rinsing my backside with a stream of water ( like most others I know ), but sometimes you just have to get over yourself and look at the bigger picture. This addon has paid for itself hand over fist, is easy to maintain, easy to install, and was a great addition to my brand new super low flow eco-toilet that already conserves a great amount of water. It's a win-win! I would suggest this product to anyone I know, help talk them through getting over their concerns about bidets, and let them see for themselves how much they can save a month just on TP. It's like the solar cell charging the battery pack for toilets.... easy on the environment, easy to maintain... and other than the small amount of water that you do use; you are saving money all the way around.

It suddenly started to leak under the controls.  Its' a small leak.  The leak also at the seams and edges.  Today, the plastic nozzle piece broke off.  Tried to submit the request online with company they want me to read the id number which is written under the bidet in tiny fonts.  They got to be kidding me.  It worked great and I loved it but it's not reliable.

Siding on the backside has never been cleaner. This will wash away even the worst effects of late night Taco Bell smothered in Diablo sauce!

Best product ever on Amazon. My wife liked it so much I bought her the upgraded one but she said she didn't need it. The regular one would have been fine. Super high quality for such a low price. Buy it and you'll thank me later. I am a colon cancer survivor and this is unbelievable.

Awesome stuff really helps the moment also fits nicely out of the way thanks

Easy to install, although they include a couple of plastic wrenches that weren't needed, as the fittings are wing nuts, able to be entirely threaded and tightened by hand.Speaking of threads, it does include enough thread tape to not only get the job done, but also in case it's not cooperating.My only complaint would be the pressure settings aren't all that variable, but it definitely gets the job done.TMI: As somebody with IBS, this is a game changer.

Broken. Leaks. Too late to return

My husband set up the bidet in less than an hour. For someone more handy it would take less time. It does the job and does it well. Our butts love this thing.

This is the 3rd purchased and the previous 2 were still doing great. I think might have the previous 2 for almost 3 years or more. I would recommend this product. I installed an extra valve at the hose  to enable control of turning on and off in case of leak

It works great it is the cleanest my ass has ever been.

We bought is for medical reasons and now we're hooked. Easy to install and leaves you feeling so much cleaner than using toilet paper. I would definitely buy this again.

Installed in my RV. Had to buy a 1/2'x1/2'x1/2' TEE to install in RV.

Easy to install work great

This is amazing!  Why did I not have one sooner.  I just had back surgery and could not twist or bend making it very hard to take care of business in the bathroom. This helped so much.  We also just help take care of an elderly father the last days of life.  This would have been so helpful with him had he had this in his home.  I will always have one in my home from this point on!  So much more sanitary .  The best purchase I have made this year.

We love them. We gave them as gifts to our kids...they weren't as happy as we were...I guess they never traveled overseas.  My house guest and visitors have gone and purchased this same item for their homes. Good product.

In this review I'm going to tell you all the good and bad about this product so take a moment to read this all the way through. Let's start off by unboxing and hooking up this product. It is very easy to do just read the manual and take your time, do not over tighten the fittings or you will get a leak, don't under tighten the fittings or you fill get a leak. When you get everything together for the first time turn the water on slowly and wait for the water noise to stop while looking for leaks. I set I piece of paper under the fitting because it didn't look like I was leaking but after a couple days I went to remove the piece of paper and noticed it was wet.I had a leak but no big deal and fixed. Next thing is when you use this remember it doesn't have a water pressure regulator which means the water is coming out pretty fast even at the lowest pressure setting. Test on your hand at first if you want but slowly and I mean slowly turn the knob till water comes out and that will be the lowest pressure. Here is my story'.. when I first got mine I just twist the knob not knowing better which sent a stream like a power washer of water at my booty hole which then I immediately jumped and fell forward off the toilet in surprise. At this time I have a stream of water spraying from my toilet over my head directly into my wall across the room.

We ordered 2 before moving into our new house. They sat in the box for several weeks and we missed the return window.The first one was great and we're happy with it. The second one must have been a returned item because it had different parts in it and the water supply splitter did not have the right connection. We were unable to use it at all.We're unable to find a replacement splitter at our local hardware store and there isn't an appropriate supply line to fix the issue either.Open and make sure you have the right parts immediately so you don't miss the return window!

Super easy to install, took me just a couple of minutes. I have one on every toilet in the house now.

We purchased one, liked it so much we purchased another for our guest bathroom.  You will not regret this purchase.

This is just Wonderful!  It's super easy to install, gets you crazy clean, and is very reasonably priced.

Great product easy to install

Just bought my third. The wife has discovered the joy of a paper-free clean-up so I equipped her bathroom with a Luxe. Let's face it - when you do your dishes, you don't wipe them with a cloth and put them away for reuse. You use water to clean them. Well, it's the same "down under"!  It sounds like a chore to use a bidet but honestly, I would not be a happy camper without one of these Luxe bidets. If you've never tried it, you are shortchanging yoursef. On a side note, it is funny to watch someone look at this easily installed device, knowing they will inevitably work the valve without lowering the lid. Hilarity ensues when they are treated to a blast of water! Seriously, though, treat yourself, bounce for the $35 or so and transform personal hygiene from a chore to an adventure in cleanliness.

Used in master toilet. It works very well.

I love this thing. Being a red neck. I've never used a brown eye sprayer or whatever these gadgets are called. But let me tell ya. I sat there for 10 minutes turning the water pressure up and down. Going around the rim. Cleaning my sack. And of course, the actual sphincter. Damn near having me think I'm gay for a second there. But nah. Just happy I could get this clean and fresh after a birthed a monster toilet trout.

My house guest and family love this easy clearing method, and no clogged toliet with boys any more.

So I really like the water pressure and the fact it has the ability to switch between booty and front bits, BUT when I switch it to front bits, it sprays straight down into the toilet. I think I just got a defective one but it's already installed and I can do a little jiggle to get all the lady bits.

All I got say I love this product so much that every towel in my house has one. Once you use it you'll think twice about using the restroom outside of your house. I've convinced several of my family members to buy one and boy do I hear about it. It works great'. I feel so clean once am don't using it etc'.

Like a clean hinny

It would have worked better with an integral pressure reducer. As it is, it tends to drill a new hole in one's butt.I had to turn the pressure down at the wall valve but that only helped a little.And it splashes onto the seat itself.I've bought problem-free bidets in the same price range. This one doesn't stack up.

I gave it 3 stars for 2 reasons.  First it didn't come with a 1/4" Ferrell to shorten the water supply line, causing me a 1 hr round trip to lowes for a 15 cent item.  Secondly why would they design this as to having the water supply hose stick out the side.  The connection could have easily been angled under the arm to keep the hose hidden and out of the way.  Now I can't get my existing trash can out of its place very easily.  So I must buy a new trash can.  Simple engineering change could of made this much better.

Bought this during quarantine when TP was in short supply. Love it. Easy to install easy to use and always feel so clean can't believe we waited so long

I love this thing. I was worried it might not work with my small, older toilet, but it fit great - no issues with the seat not closing or anything. It was very easy to install, I didn't even need the thoughtfully enclosed wrenches. And I live in an apartment! After using it for a few weeks I've really come to miss it when I am away. Pro tip: if you don't get the results you want right away, keep experimenting. I found you have to relax your "down there" muscle for optimum cleaning.

30 minutes and voila! Everything I needed for my particular installation was in the box. Works great, but this is the first day. I will update if I have any problems. UPDATE: 5 weeks later the self clean doesn't work! I used the self ckean twice since I bought it. 1, to see if it worked after install. 2 to actually clean. I will contact the seller to see what they do. I will update again.

We are all human, we all do our business, so why is it so uncomfortable to talk about it?The comedian Jim Gaffigan jokes that "the bathrooms in Japanese airports are the only airports in the entire world where you actually come out cleaner than when you went in." The reason, being, is that all the toilets have internal bidets (and other stuff like heaters, air blowers, etc.)This product works exactly as described, the install was easy, and has sort of changed my world a little, only having used it once.Again. We are all human. We all excrete. If you were a baboon using a stick and offered toilet paper, would you refuse? If you were a human using toilet paper....You get the idea. Highly recommended, especially for the price.

I bought this product August of 2020, and didn't install it until almost January 2021.  It started failing earlier this year (2022) the nozzle gets stuck and won't function properly.  I have cleaned the nozzle many, many times and it will work, then gets stuck in between uses!  The "clean-jet" setting works just fine, so I know the nozzle isn't dirty; it just fails when you want to use it in the Bidet setting.  I have a cheaper, generic Bidet with lower quality parts and it has never failed after almost 3 years of use.

If you never owned a bidet buy it you will never wanna be without it guaranteed!

The best, especially when the monthly visitor stops by.

it was little difficult to install it.You can control the pressure.

If you weren't prone to fits of rage and swearing before trying to install this, you will be after.  The installation is rage inducing.  I wish I had tried to install it before the return window closed... if I had, I would have boxed it back up and returned it.  But I didn't.  Now, I just want to take is out back and smash it with a sledge hammer.  I hate this thing.  Buy something better than this.  I wish I had

Need to purchase bumpers or you have to lift up on it to work

Might be the best but u less I can find fittings I willne er know.

I am very pleased with the LUXE Bidet Neo 120. Was very easy to install and preforms excellently. I have ordered a second one. Can't believe the price for such a nice product.2nd Review; I have now been using daily for 3 weeks.  As an older person with a recent bowel problem due to meds, the LUXE Bidet Neo 120 is a necessary . It is easy to install and works great. Takes a little getting used to. Don't wait for months like I did. Get the relief now.

I ordered two of these for Christmas presents and they  started leaking within a month, I didn't know for about 6 months.

This thing is flawless. Comes with everything needed for install down to some disposable wrenches and plumbers tape. The instructions are very clear and take moments to warn you of potential pitfalls. You too, can experience the smug superiority of being the only of your peers with a regularly washed butt. My water is freezing cold locally and I don't even notice when I use this thing, so if you're on the fence about the lack of heating, don't be. Buy one today, ascend above the common, red-cheeked wiping rabble.

Works just fine. The installation was a little bit annoying, but not too bad. It's expected to put in a little bit of effort when installing an attachment to an appliance. Takes a second to get it pointed correctly but when it works, it works. The pressure, as the company says, is based on the home pressure, so for comments about there being too much pressure, it's just because they have high pressure in their plumbing at home. Like some showers require just small turns of the hot water knob to get it to that right temperature, they just have to ease the dial slowly to get it to the right pressure. I'd say, for the price, this was well worth it.

A bit cheap looking, Doesn't feel super strong.

Lord JESUS.... Thank you for giving man the knowledge to not only invent but make it affordable for us common folks..... This is easy to install and when I tell you your in for a treat when you use it for the first time.... I mean it. My behind is still laughing.

Does a great job of cleaning all the bits!

The ratings asked me to rate the temperature control but this one specifically doesnt offer that option. That said, I bought one of these a couple years ago to try it out and ended up buying one again recently for my other bathroom. I've gifted one to several friends and family. It's that good of a deal. It does what its supposed to. You can set how hard or soft it sprays and I save a ton of money on toilet paper.

Was surprised by how small the packaging was and streamline the product is. Following the install instructions and everything was setup and ready to roll in 20 mins, with all the tools included.The product itself is great and very easy to use. I have the cold water version of the product and it works very very well, being great to use warmer days

Have bought 4 of these and installed them in various homes over the past few years. This model is great value for money.

Installed two bidets. One worked fine, the other the flexible hose leaked where the hose connects to its nut. Very disappointed. The should have better quality control.

This is amazing. I recently had back surgery and cannot bend or twist at the waist.. which obviously makes going to the bathroom and cleaning properly afterwards difficult. Easy to instal, easy to use and thoroughly cleans! ??

It works fine for about 3 years, after 3 years we had to change some plastic parts

This is a must have. I hate using bathroom any where else

I bought this for a cleaner feel. Husband installed it, said I was nuts for buying it. Now he comes home especially to use the toilet

It was good initially then later few weeks it sopped working functionally

Video not that great but the product is good! Glad person in the house is mechanically inclined

Returned for upgrades one

If you value personal cleanliness like I do you owe it to yourself to have a bidet in your bathroom .  This bidet was easy to install works great and I feel fresh after using it

I already bought two of these and recommended it to family. The second one started to drip when it is off after 3 months of use. Called their customer support and they promptly replaced it.

A piece of plastic broke on our old one (different brand) and wasn't as steady as prior, so bought this a replacement.  Works fine as is.  On these things I normally take out the water saving screen, but the pressure with this one with it in is just fine.  The self cleaning aspect of it actually works great!  Only thing that's a downside, which was also in the installation video I found online, is that it sprays a little forward from where you'd expect.  I have elongated; Not sure if that makes a difference.  Do a little scoot prior to turning on and you're good.

Anywhere without a bidet feels so unclean. I seriously underestimated how much would change with a bidet. I don't know how I lived just wiping with toilet paper in the past.This works just as well as the expensive models. The only downsides are:1. Its not heated (you get used to it though, its not a big deal)2. The pressure is insane. Seriously, be careful. Slowly turn it up to learn what you need or else you'll accidentally give yourself an enema.Aside from those 2 things, its fabulous. Easy install and I've never felt cleaner after dropping the kids off at the pool.

It was easy to install and I was super excited to use it, but I knew the risk of getting a cheap bidet. The water pressure and precision was nice on the first 2 uses. On the 3rd use, and every time after, the nozzle started to spray less accurately. The water started to shoot out in different directions instead of hitting the 'target.' Water ended up leaking out from the gap of the toilet seat and I was getting completely drenched. I recommend shelling out a few more bucks for something of better quality or different brand.

Knobs start falling apart and eroding, so disgusting

No Media

Lived in Asia for over 13 years. Bought a new toilet seat and decided to order the Bidet with it. Glad I did. Its worthy of 20 stars in my opinion. Best purchase this year!!

Works good. Would like to be adjustable

I went to a friends house and she had this and I bought one for my own house before I even left. I LOVE it!! It makes me feel so clean! The intensity knob is great! The self cleaning feature is great! The little protective door broke a couple weeks after we got it, but it doesn't affect the function, so maybe keep an eye out for that if it seemingly stops working even though you can hear water.

I bought this same product for my home and was so impressed by it, I bought one for my motorhome (Thor 29M). I wasn't sure it would work (fit, water pressure, mounting). My biggest concern was if the water pump in the RV had enough water pressure to operate properly...it does! It doesn't quite hit "the target", but with a little body adjustment, it was spot on. I'm very happy with the setup.Because I was installing this in my motorhome, the fittings are not compatible that come in the box as they are made for the standard home plumbing. Most RV toilets have the same fittings (1/2"). If you plan do this this, you have to buy this part below.....connects right-up and works great!One other benefit...this will reduce the amount of TP that is used and consequently dumped into the tank preventing it from filling up as fast.Beduan Stainless Steel 1/2" G 3 Way Diverter, Movable Cap Flexible Tee Connector for Angled Valve, Bidet, Sprayer, Shower Arm

Really happy with this bidet as quality and ease of installation.

I've installed 5 bidets before this one: 3 in my house, 1 each at my daughter and son's houses.  4 of them have been Luxe Bidets.  The first one was another brand.  They all work well, however, I prefer the Luxe as a single stream of water means your butt gets less wet, but does the job where needed.I rated the installation 1 star b/c I installed this in a travel trailer.  Everything about a TT is oddball and really complicated the install.  The space to work in is very restricted.  I had to modify the plastic, cut a small opening in the sidewall of the storage space adjacent to the toilet and have a custom-made "T" as the water lines on RVs are 1/2", not 3/4" like a house toilet.  The bidets that I installed at home were quite easy after the first one learning curve.I didn't rate the Temperature b/c I installed in a cold water line.  The first bidet at home I installed a "Bum Warmer", but I didn't on the other 2 and I don't find the cold water, even in winter, is overly uncomfortable.There is no "softness" on a bidet.  It is installed under the normal toilet seat, so the softness of the toilet seat dictates any softness.One caveat for anyone planning to install a bidet in an RV is to make sure the sprayer housing that sticks out doesn't prevent you from sitting on the seat properly.  I discovered that I had to shift myself as far forward as possible.  If I had to do it all over again, I'd change to a wand bidet.  I didn't think of that until I visited a friend who uses the wand-style and it's so much easier to install.

We love our bidet, never felt so clean. My husband use it for medical reasons, mine is for pleasure. Bought our neighbor one , she loves it. Going to buy another one for the 2nd bathroom.

This was such an easy install. Only took 10 minutes after reading the directions. Great warranty.  A perfect option for those not wanting to mess with electrical.

This Bidet was purchased after a visit to my sisters home in which she had one installed. Out of curiosity I tried it out and could not believe how much cleaner my bottom end felt afterwards. Be Cleaner on the bottom end, no stains in your under ware, and save on toilet paper at the same time! Very few Win, Wins these days, but this is one. I installed it in about 20 minutes, and it comes with everything you need to install. Register it and you get an additional 2 years warranty. It works perfectly as expected and I would recommend to friends and family. Price is very reasonable.

Less wiping, more freshness

It works great, nice and clean!

Easy to install. Works as described. Saves on TP big-time and the wife loves it.

It's very good for the price.  Works great and does what it needs to do.

I lived in Japan for years and now, not having a bidet at home seems strange to me. I bought this to replace a similar but cheaper one I'd bought four years ago that started dripping.This one seems better made. Installation was easy (I'm not very handy). Came with everything I needed though by choice I used some of my own wrenches. Didn't come with much Teflon tape so you might want to have a roll of your own. This isn't a complaint as most appliances don't come with it anyhow. I just consider what came with it as a bonus.I just bought this and it's working great. I'll update this review if anything changes.

It works great!!

I use less toilet paper, and feel cleaner.Everyone should get a bidet!

And then one of the dials broke off. Its a plastic dial, glued to metal. So the plastic eventually gave way. So that's the reason for the -1 star. The aesthetics aren't that great. Its actually a little embarrassing to have this huge thing sticking out like it does, and explain to people what it is. But ever since I bought it (3 years ago) more companies are starting to make them built into toilet seats, and hidden. That will be the next purchase, now that I have to use a pair of pliers to turn the dial because of the broken plastic.

Glad I purchased this instead of a more expensive one that I also use.  Great value for the cost.

I like this bidet.  It is inexpensive but works well. Was not difficult to install.

I am really advanced in age, (86 years old), and I found that by following the specific instructions in the package, LUXE Bidet Neo 120, is very easy to install. Anyone that can handle a screwdriver and can move the hands to tighten the parts requiring just that, can do it. Once installed, it works exceeding expectations. You will fill refreshed and clean after the bowl movement. It is just what anyone needs after doing this needed bodily function. I highly recommend this product for those to like to be refreshed and clean, specially at an advanced age, it just feels wonderful. I would like to mention that I bought two (2) LUXE Bidet Neo 120, one for each bathroom in my house.Octavio Garcia, a very satisfied customer.

It is certainly true that it fit on my two piece toilet. But the aim is so far forward I can only use it if I sit on the rim.  Since there isn't a way to adjust the aim, this issue should at least have been mentioned in the description, instead of claiming it will fit with no problems.

This took me, a 64 year old granny, about 10 minutes to install.  I don't know what the plastic wrenches were for, they didn't fit any of the fittings, but I have my own tools and was ready with channel locks.  Only one fitting required the teflon tape, the others were pressure fittings on which you don't use it.  I always save the extra, so no loss there.  I did not feel there was too much pressure when using the device, it seemed just right to me.  I have ibs-d, so this device is fantastic.  Very soothing to those irritated tissues after a flare up (the cool water feels great).  I highly recommend this to anyone with diarrhea prominent issues like me.  Also, I had hand surgery which made wiping difficult, so this rinse was definitely a help with that.  My only problem is that, now, my daughters and granddaughters all want one, so I know what Christmas will be for them this year.

Very easy to install. Works great and saves toilet paper. We have 3 of them installed. My wife and I love them!

Very easy installation

Be sure to check the original box seal. My box was open and retaped as if someone returned it. Not sure if it was used or not, but not taking any chances. Sending it back! Gross

I've been using this for 4 months now. No more shaffing from excessive wiping. Warm water would be really nice, but the plumbing would be awkward. You still need a wad of TP to blot the water and check for, well, you know. But it's so much less abrasive. I love it!

So fresh and so clean!

My bathroom toilet pipe is only cold water. The device is hard but it doesn't play in part in the comfort of the toilet seat

I am never going back. I love this.

Got this for Christmas for my husband. It took him months and months to install it because he thought it was silly and unnecessary. After finally giving into me telling him to try it he loves it. He will never go back to dry wiping again.

The angle for spraying is wrong and it doesn't hit your tooshie correctly.

This thing is a cheap Chinese piece of junk. Flooded my toilet twice. Luckily I was home and was able to shut the main valve. The rivet does not screw tight, it eventually loosens due to the water pressure and starts to come off. Terrible product a definite no. Buyer beware!

I was actually impressed with the ease of installation and all the products supplied to do the install. I bought one bidet, then after using it, we bought the second one. I feel so much cleaner than before. I'm giving this 5 stars. Go get one. See for yourself!

Recommend a new toilet seat when you purchase the bidet!! Or your toilet seat is not flush to the toilet itself, thank you!!

I just don't understand why a company would use a "one size fits all" or "one size fits most" motto when it is just not the case. I bought this bidet thinking it would be a super easy install and setup. Nope. Bidet doesn't fit. Toilet seat won't shut with it on. So you don't find out it doesn't fit until you are completely done with installation and then you have to undo everything you just did. Please just tell people to measure their toilet and make sure they're getting the correct product for their situation instead of making people waste a ton of time like I had to.

I did modify a little bit the installation...did not fits well...

na

I was really needing this when I had a medical issue and have found that I continue to use it daily.  I have put two of them in my house and recommend them to every woman.

Funciona muy bien! super recomendable!

We got it for my brother in law who had a stroke and came to live with use. He loves it.

Easy install works great

Easy to install, exactly what I was looking for, we have in all our bathrooms would definitely recommend

Works great, easy to install and has me wondering why I didn't switch to a bidet sooner. The model I have doesn't have temperature control but that's no problem.Easy to keep both the product and yourself clean.

I am sure this bidet fine, but I wanted the female spray too. Returned this 120 version for the Luxe 185 version to use with our Dometic 320 RV toilet. Great company! Excellent customer service no matter which version you buy.

First bidet I've used but it is am absolutely game changer. Easy installation and works perfect.

I did not think I would like a bidet HOWEVER... this thing is great. Always a clean behind!! Easy clean, adjustable pressure. Easy install.

No Media

It's ok. Be careful of the strength of the water coming out. It's  definitely different. Should have bought a heated one though. Brrr.

Before buying this, check your toilet seats. As seen in the pictures, my toilet seat has a round piece around the screw. Because of this, the bidet won't fit properly. I have reached out to customer service to see if there's a solution, but am waiting on their response

Love this thing, super easy install, super easy to use, would recommend to anyone.

Works great.

At first, everything worked out fine. The product does the job of a regular bidet. But then the nozzle clean function started to fail for some reason. I don't know what happened, but the fact that that was a feature was the main reason I chose this over the others. Now nothing about it stands out from the rest. Also there is no temp control

I had the same problem my son had when he installed in his home.  With the new T fitting it makes the distance to the shut off closer and the flex line is now too long.  I had trouble finding a flex line that was short enough and not have it curl around a bunch.  Otherwise it seems to be working fine and I still gave it 5 stars because maybe not all are such close distances as ours were.  Note sink and toilet flex lines are not the same, toilets use 3/8 to 7/8 fittings where sinks use 3/8 to 3/4 fittings.

Using a bidet has been a game changer for my defecating experience.  No more seemingly endless wiping followed by chaffing.  I leave the bathroom feeling fresh and clean!

This product is honestly really hard to hookup to your toilet. The explanation seems easy but once you actually get into doing it, you realize how hard it really is. Not to mention you can mess up your toilet easily if you install it even slightly wrong. I recommend getting a bidet that has easier installation and costs a bit more fo what it's worth. I wish this product would've worked out for me, but it just didn't. Leaving three stars though because the return process was very quick and easy.

Just had it installed today.  It works well even on very low pressure setting.  The only issue I have is that I am a bigger person and my butt/thigh overflows onto the controls.  It doesn't interfere with operation since I don't really need to see the controls to work them but, I wish the location of the controls was adjustable.

I got this because I wanted help cleaning the Bum after major surgery. When I installed it I needed to buy a new toilet seat  but other than that it was easy to install. The water flow at 1st was INTENSE but I learned to adjust. Let me say that I LOVE this appliance and a $$ deal I feel confident that there's nothing left behind. Every one asks how about drying off? I keep hand towel close Don't think it's gross you dry that part after shower. I wish  I had bought this LONG AGO..

I don't care that they don't have temperature control because I live in Florida, and the cold water never gets that cold. I didn't install them, so I can't address that.  I tried them at my son's house and liked them, however I did not know that one's water pressure in one's home makes a different as to how strongly the water comes out.  What was a nice, gentle wash at my son's house became more like a mini firehose at mine even at the lowest setting.  They might work wonderfully for you, as they did for my son.

Why did I take this long to get this.....omgggg no plumber needed, no extra tools needed. My gift to everyone for birthday, wedding, anniversary and ofcourse house warming just got easiest. Everyone needs this just like we need daily cleanliness. Westerners please get this into law quickly, hotels, airbnb get with this program. I got 2 now. I will have to come home for 2 always public restrooms ain't got nothing on mine.

Imagine a scenario that has played out countless times in the history of men. You are out mowing on a hot day. As you toil away sweating in the hot sun, you feel that all too familiar feeling of a massive dump coming up on deck. Maybe it was the Chipotle, or maybe the PF Chang's, but one thing for sure is that it won't wait until you're done mowing. As you head into the toilet, you are overcome with a feeling of dread, as you know the futility of trying to wipe a pile of mud from a grassy ditch with a paper towel. Add to that the prospect of doing this in a state of sweaty swamp ass, and you're looking at an eternity of wiping your raw stink star to death, or giving in and hopping in the shower and calling it a day.If this describes you, then do yourself and your purple skittle a favor and buy and use this bidet. Instead of the Sophie's choice above, why not rejoice in knowing that you will not only feel the relief of dropping a massive pile of wolf bait, but also clean, cool and refresh your muddy dirt cave with a stream of water at the turn of a knob? Say goodbye the time consuming post-dump shower, to eternal wipe-a-thons, and to racing stripes.Installation is very easy, and so far it works very well. The stream is pretty strong, even on the lowest setting, so if you're a bidet virgin like I was, move the dial very slow or you'll get an enema. It only uses cold water, but that's fine with me, since even in the winter, nothing feels better after dominating a growler than a cold spray of water to clean and refresh the dusty old dirt cave. There is a 'self-clean' setting that basically lets water flow over the nozzle to rinse it off as it sprays, but if you are sitting on it with this setting, make sure to turn the water off before turning it back to the spray mode or you'll get a wet beanbag.After several months, I must say, I don't miss wiping, but a word to the wise: after each use, your mahogany slide will need a gentle pat-down with a few patches of TP to dry the ditch. If you skip this step you'll end up with a fromunda factory from your back to your balls the likes of which not even a Dutchman could imagine.All in all, a good purchase.

Best decision for our life

Very easy to install and hits the target every time.  We added a pressure control T valve to go with it.

Bought it during the TP apocalypse in 2020, and its been working great since then, with one minor issue: It has a little door that covers the bidet spray, and with regular use it starts to fail as it sits a bit too flushed agains the toilet seat, so it blocks the sprayer. i fixed it a few times but ended up removing it, seems quite unnecessary. In any case, I still give it 5 stars, fantastic and life changing product.

This is a great product, and soo easy to install. Everyone should have one

This waste if money works maybe one out of every 10 times I try to use it. The part that extends downward when water pressure is applied usually doesn't extend, so instead of spraying on you, it sprays out the back of the toilet and goes all over the floor. There's no adjustment to make, nothing to lubricate, nothing to clean. It's simply cheap injection molded plastic with incredibly poor tolerances that simply doesn't work. Trust me, but a better unit. This one is garbage. After fighting it for months, it ended up in the trash

Great price for a bidet that does the job.

Quite easy to install all the tools are in the box, works pretty well. Beats using a paper to scrape your bottom.

We'd been reading about bidets for a while and finally, decided to get one for each bathroom.I don't need to go into all the reasons why a bolt-on bidet makes sense.  These were easy to install--maybe 10 minutes for the first one then more like 5 minutes each for the remaining two.  I did use my own real wrench but if you don't have one I'm sure the included plastic wrench is more than up to the job.The temperature control is "climate controlled water" as in controlled by the climate.  These hook up to the water feed to the toilet and in our house at least that is straight cold water.  Surprisingly, even in the dead of winter, the cold water is just fine.

we tried to up load a video of how clean this product works,  but my wife told me I couldn't. She's a strict woman. So you'll have to take my word for it that my butt is squeaky clean. Well, it's squeaky anyway.

Easy to install

Hubby wasn't convinced we needed one of these, but he installed it without complaint.  Next morning, he sheepishly came and told me "that you might as well order another one for the other bathroom".  :)  It's low tech, no frills, works great, easily installed, price is right and we love it.  We hate going to stay anywhere away from home now!!

All I have to say is, I am WAYYYYY fresher when I use a bidet! I'm not sure why these arnt standard in the US. This was very easy to install an my apartment and I'm excited for my new bidet life!! MAKE THE CHANGE

First they sent me a defective bidet. When I returned it, they charged me a 20% restocking fee!! I wouldn't buy this product or any product from this merchant ever again!!

Works great!  Don't go past level 2 unless you are trying to clean the back of your teeth

Great

Give it 10-15 seconds to pressurize depending on your water source,  DON'T STAND UP DURING THIS.  :)

Why oh Why did i wait 70 years to install this!!  The owners manual and helpful videos are among the best i've seen, and trust me as an IT professional i've seen many a software tech writer output and contracts.The only installation issue was my water push/ pull shut off.  .  i finally gave up and turned off the whole house water shut off.. anyway been using the bidet for a few days and i love it.

It stopped working in 5 days. Extremely disappointed.

Packaging was as expected.  Installation was simple and easy. But as far as meeting my expectations.....NOT!  It doesn't work all of the time.  It works in Nozzle cleaning whenever the selector switch is in the cleaning position.  But, when you put it back in position that you expect the Bidet to function as required......NOTHING!!  No water, and switching back and forth between position to clean the nozzle and the bidet function doesn't help no matter how often you switch it back and forth.  Then later, maybe later, it will work - but don't count on it.....very disappointed - I personally will not recommend this product!

This thing is fantastic. Easy to install and easy to use.

What we like is that it's convenient to wash.

I don't use this because I've never had much of a problem with cleanliness after defecating but.... my poor spouse, no matter what he does, always ends up smelling bad. Always.Figured we'd try the bidet hype and it is revolutionary. There is no longer odd stink all the time on his body. If you or anyone you know suffers from, "generally funky body smells" you really have to give this a try.

It's a drinking fountain for short people

I love this bidet! It works so well and was extremely easy to install. I am very impressed. Worth every penny!

Replaced an older model that didn't have the fumction of cleaning the nozzle. Installation was as simple as the previous. Came with tools to tighten water line connections unlike the last one. The included water line splitter is metal instead of plastic as the previous. The spray is a whole lot softer than the previous but still gets the job done.Happy with the product so far.Previous lasted 8 years (Neo 110).

Must have item! Easy to install and keeps our butts clean. We bought a second one because it is that great. I wish I had realize before I could have a bidet at this price point.

This is the first bidet I have ever used. My parents have this model and they love it as well. Definitely glad I bought it. So far I've had no issues with it.

Your luxe bidet Neo 120 design looks very good.But this bidet does not fit to my toilet seat.  Bottom side of toilet seat push the top of the nozzleassembly area and I cannot seat down.  I have to return this item for refund.

I got this bidet one year ago and love it! It is wonderful and work very well. Water pressure is regulable and I like it very much, left my butt clean and I miss it very much when traveling. I also got a second one form a expensive Japanese brand that cost 20 time more, with all kind of functions bu it is not as good as this simple model. There is not temperature control in this model , I just use it with cold water and it is OK since I live in a tropical rea.  Highly recommended!

Half as a joke and half as an honest trial, we purchased this unit over 3 years ago now, and haven't looked back.Not only has it performed flawlessly to date, I must concede that my perception of a quality "morning routine" has been forever changed.From the point of installation onward, my standards for "where and when" have been based on the overall satisfaction of having this installed at home. No other local commode holds a candle.Buy one. Splurge a bit and get one with a hot water mixing option and really up your throne game. You'll wonder how you even managed beforehand.

I don't know why Americans don't use bidets. They are used all over the world. During the pandemic, I didn't have a toilet paper shortage.

My tuch has never been so clean

Excellent product

How did I go so long without it

Update- very good customer service.They replaced the knobs with no issuesThe bidet is functioning well and the installed is easy but the knobs are made with cheap chrome coating that oxidize (green) and peal after short period- see picture

I wasn't sure about this but figured I'd give it a try. Glad I did. It was delivered crazy fast, came well packaged, good instructions and easy to install. Best part it that it works amazingly. It looks good too.  How did I live without it? Look forward to my morning dump just to use it. I did have to get a replacement water feed line because the one on my bowl was a rigid plastic but the local home store had plenty in different sizes plus they were the better braided type. Overall 100% satisfied and glad I got it.

We liked ours so much we bought these gifts

I use it everytime I go to the toilet!

Love it !!! Love it!!! Excellent!!! 5 stars!!! Honestly  you won't regret buying it!! Makes your life feels so great!!??

This bidet is easy to install on any toilet. We have one on each of our toilets. Try it and you will find out what you have been missing for years.

We had to figure out a where our water valve shut off but once we did it was pretty easy to set up! It has a flip cover that makes sure to keep the spray clean & can be flipped to wash! Also the setting to clean the spray is awesome!! The different pressures are nice I'm in love with my bidet I'll never ever go back ?? 10/10 recommend !! (Ignore my trash I was cleaning the toilet & bidet while installing lol)

Allows immediate cleaning of your body to eliminate any odor

I love the freshness you feel after using it.  Don't know how I ever lived without it

I can't believe how inexpensive this bidet is. This was our first bidet and we instantly understood what all the hype was for. It was quick and easy to install, and allows for awesome control. We are totally converted after one day. For the price especially, this is a no-brainer.

SERIOUS water pressure!

Even though the price is questionable, when I got mine and used it, it did an amazing job and get it ???.

It works great, and it was logical for us not to buy one for hot water since it takes forever for hot water to hit our 2nd floor bathroom. It works exactly how we expected it to and are very happy we got it. I'm sure we will save a lot in toilet paper!

Third purchase for the last 5 years. Can see the improvement over time.

Bidet works perfectely.

This is a great product and works great. It was easy to install and came with everything you needed. I just wish I had gotten this back when we had the toilet paper shortage.

This is the second LUXE Bidet I've purchased. Easy to install, easy to use; overall Excellent product.

I originally bought this product for several reasons: toilet paper savings ($), improved hygiene, increased gentleness in sensitive areas compared to paper.On all accounts I am genuinely impressed.I use toilet paper at a fraction of the rate I used to (for drying only). I feel IMEASURABLY cleaner. For real, I feel spoiled at home and miss this when I'm out. As for the gentleness, I was skeptical that a stream of water would not be kind. I am happy to report that I've actually found the water to be much more comfortable in sensitive areas than toilet paper. I hadn't even realized how abrasive the paper had been!I thought I would miss the lack of temperature control in this model but haven't at all. Ambient water temp is far from the freezing water I envisioned.Overall the process took some routine adjustment after years of going without a bidet. The controls were easy to interpret and made the transition much easier.I found installation to be surprisingly simple, even for someone like me with zero plumbing knowledge.This will change your life. I even gifted one to my mom.

One of the top of self install, I live in Arizona, so water temperature is not an issue. Yes even in the winter. But if I lived back on the east, deluxe model would be mine

Magnificent, worth you money. Impressive.

Excelente, funciona muy bien y f'cil de instalar.

Not a dood design. You have to raise the front seat because of the sprayer design/position.

Recomendable que lo instale un professional, una mala instalaci'n puede provocar escape de agua y da'os considerables

Saving money on toilet paper

VERY POWERFUL if more than low.After several failed attempts at installing it, I got it. Had to go to the hardware store to get a washer because the toilet connector didn't fit.

This is very easy to install and it gets the job very well done! Is super easy to maintain clean since it has a shield that guards it from getting splashed or peed on and it has a self cleaning spray to always give it a good rinse before use. Is affordable and it looks really nice too, I highly recommend it to everyone who would like to have one!

ecretly in her schoolbag on her birthday. My baby likes it very much, and her friends also like it very much. It's a very good shopping!I will continue to buy it next time and recommend it to everyone

I'm very happy and my kidos are going to so happy.

Great for party giveaways

Like the price and quality of the gloves, easy to put on and good for cooking or cleaning.

I'm happy with my purchase. The gloves are a perfect size and material. Thanks

The gloves fit my hand well and I usually get one use out of them.  They are adequate for what I need.

I use at work.  Use for touchscreens.  Last for hours.

can put these on and they do not tear when I use them sometimes twice !!

Pretty sturdy gloves. Used them for cleaning.

Gloves fit my hands.  Easy to put on.  Gloves do not tear when placing them on my hands.

I use these gloves a lot. They are strong and comfortable.

good

Wow

I like the way the gloves fit, the convenience and the durability,

I like them. They are latex free

Great size

I use these for cooking, changing my cat box, and pumping gas or at the atm. They give me piece of mind.

I bought both medium and large size gloves to use around the house. Although I generally fit in a medium glove, I found that the larger size is easier to fit into in humid conditions.My wife uses the medium and I use the large size gloves.

I'm an elderly caregiver and I've had terrible quality gloves that have torn as I've put them on. These so far are sturdy and serve my needs.

I have been using these gloves for the last three years. Good quality, they don’t rip easily and hold up to the task.

Used for baking. Great fit.

I bought these at the start of the Covid-19 lockdowns. I have gone through 3 boxes. I really really like these. They are hard to break and I can use my phone while wearing them. They fit my hands perfectly and I have never had one break putting them on. And I am usually rushing. Good product I highly recommend.

Good product that's why I keep buying it

Good value for the $

I use these for when I'm cleaning my cats' litter boxes. They're great. They don't tear or slip and keep my hands out of the actual muck!

Great product!  I use these gloves for everything!

That they were meant to. No static nor annoying clingy issues with other gloves when I pull one out of the box. Repeat purchase.

Easy on and easy off.Medium is a good fit for me.Work as a cashier and these gloves make me feel more secure handling money.

I use them cooking and cleaning

I use these when I scoop cat litter! First kind I found that does not rip or tear. I am sticking with this brand!

Strength

Fast shipping, product as described

I ordered the medium gloves based on reviews that the gloves run small.  When I received my order, the gloves were size small.  I thought I made an error and doublechecked my order.  I did in fact order the medium.  I normally wear a small,  but the small gloves were so small I couldn't get them on.  I called Amazon to get the correct size.  I gave the small gloves to my daughter.  I then noticed that the sticker on the box showed medium; however the box indicated the gloves are small.  There is a discrepancy on the box, which is what caused the error.  Hopefully Amazon can make the correction to avoid this error from happening again.  The medium fit and the gloves are fine now that they are the correct size and they definitely run small order up one size.

Great buy on 100 disposable gloves!  Comfortable, fit well and durable.  I will buy again!

I use these gloves in my kitchen, cleaning behind my pets, etc.

Gloves are easy to put on. I've only had a few that tore when I put them on. If you're dealing with grease or any thick drainage issues put on two pair. Over all, these are pretty good gloves.  Work well when I clean the bathrooms.

Really great gloves for all kinds of stuff, I always have a box in my bathroom.

Love these gloves!  They keep my hands clean and easy to remove!

Great for use when handling raw meat

sanitary cleansing

I love these gloves for making burgers, meatloaf, etc.  About to order again.

good gloves. use them for painting and dying. can get 2 or 3 uses out of them before they start tearing. not for heavy duty use like working in the garage on cars or the like. But great for light duty use. Serves our needs and good price. Will be buying more when I run low.

Very durable

Works perfectly fine for me, helps me color hair without getting crazy color dyes on my fingers, helps with the sanitary with doing clients lashes. I even use them at home to clean my home or cool to chop up meat. I’m picky when it comes to gloves because I use them for everything in business and home and these are by far the best for quality and price 👍🏻

Works fine

The gloves fit quite well and are quite durable considering the low price.  I use them in gardening and find my hands don't dry out working with dirt.  In fact they stay quite moist.

These are durable gloves.

Durable, Comfortable gloves that are powder-free and great for general-purpose uses.

Comfortable and sturdy - I think I need to go down one size and my family can use the mediums.  I mostly use them for handling raw poultry/meat at home. My son uses them to clean out his Guinea pig habitat.

They work real good for what I bought them for.  Cleaning the house

The headline covers all.

The gloves are just the right thickness to prepare and serve food. They are sized perfectly. Much better than the ordinary size-fits-all gloves.

I can't use the gloves with the latex lining. These are perfect.  Hands don't sweat the gloves are durable and fit my small hands well.  I take care of my elderly Mother..need the gloves throughout the day and night. With  the sicknesses going around I wear them into the Grocery store now. Keep these on my prime shipping so I won't run out and this seller never lets me down!! Thank you!

Purchased these for my older mom... she likes to wear them when applying prescription creams and other cleaning.  She has a small to medium hand and the medium fits her perfectly. Comes in a dispenser type slot box.

Durability comfort and it’s worth your money to buy these gloves

The gloves fit me so well. I use them for applying ointment and working with raw meat. Saves my hands from frequent washing.

Good for use in kitchen.

I would buy them again. Easy to put on and they was easy to on.  My skin broke out with the difference sanitizer. My hands are cleared up.  I don't leave the house without  two or three part in my bag and my husband wear them to. I will buy them again when I run out. I got 400 of them. If you have problem with your hands BUY it's worth buying them.  Be safe.  Jan Carter

These gloves fit well and are versatile

I use them to clean with...I help other friends and family out with cleaning and very pleased with them

I always get medium sized gloves and these fit perfectly. I even did a stretch test putting them on and they didn't tear or break. Not to say they won't tear or break (there's always a few that will break). The pair I put just didn't tear or break. I used to get 100 vinyl gloves from the store in the home improvement section for $6-$8 dollars, so the price is a little high. Other than pricing, these are good!

The gloves work good.

I’ve used this product many many times and have rebought boxes and boxes.  I use them for cooking or cleaning or just being safe because they are amazing and comfortable

They're worn by my wife. Doing miscellaneous chores and doing dishes. They seem to be durable as she has had no complaints about them. The price was good and delivery was quick.

Durability.  Long time use without holes.

Glad I got them.

The product itself was fine.But paid for faster shipping and it came very late

These gloves are a good fit and are very comfortable.

I like how they go on with ease but my hand sweats so much in them.

Great value for the money and for using as a one time disposable glove. However they run very small I would advise sizing up one size

I use many  gloves throughout the day. Some of my favorite features are:  1 They are easy to put on.  2 They don't break or crack if doing light or medium cleanup.  3 Bad odors do not leach onto my hands.  4.  The cost is low bit the quality is not.

Good value for the price.

Took some time but it was needed to do some cleaning.

Had to try all sizes before finding one that fits.  These are thin but are great single use gloves for food preparation.  I use these for making biscuits, mixing meatloaf, salmon patties, etc.  They stay on well and do not slip off when mixing food.  Exactly what I needed!

Cooking on a restaurant grill; food prep.

I normally purchase Nitrile gloves, however, the prices of them are now prohibitive for me to purchase. My daughter mentioned she switched to Vinyl gloves, and these are the one's that I tried. I'm happy with them. I do have nails that break through them from time to time more frequently, but for the reasonable price, I can continue with these as is.

My cat has a thyroid problem where she requires meds twice a day. I must put her meds on my finger and rub on her eae..skin part. Must use later gloves. I have been using these gloves since Oct 2021. They are great..I have no problem with them. I have also used them periodically for washing things. I have only good things to say about these latex gloves.  C washington

The heading has all the pun intended. Although in seriousness, these gloves are quite thin, but allow for adequate usage.Pros:-Elasticity (just enough to stretch when putting on).-Fits most hand sizes (that is, if your hand is applicable in scaling. A smaller hand could use larger gloves, but not vice-versa).Cons:Aside from collecting moisture through extended exposure in indoor/outdoor work the gloves are of suffice quality.Do be-careful while handling cold, hot, and sharp items. These will not protect you from such extremes.

I use these gloves for so many purposes.  I have chronic pain and hence I'm applying creams and sprays several times a day; they keep my hands clean from all these products.  I also use them to clean and wash dishes.  If I have to put a bandage on a finger I just put on a glove and I am able to complete any task without getting cut etc. wet or dirty.  Can not be without them!

No problems with wear. Good quality!

Perfect size, comfortable and firm texture, good transparency.I'll order more.

These gloves are nice. They are true to size and don't break when I pull them on. They are great too if your allergic to latex. These are latex free.

The gloves are very much stuck to each other and hard to separate through the box opening on top.

Nice

I was pleased with the gloves; I’ll use them when I mix ingredients in my bowl. I’ll be having a cook out in the park and these gloves will be handy when handling the food from the grill or even when serving. Arrived on time. I love Amazon!

These are lightweight but durable and fit just right, exactly what I needed. I am sensitive to cleaners and these protect my skin.

hard to find very useful

Between covid and owning 5 dogs, my skin was suffering from excessive hand washing.  These gloves have been a godsend.  They're great in the kitchen too.

Condition if boxes

Really nice latex gloves. The medium size fits nice and NO POWDER! They don't tear when I slide them on like other gloves do. I'll always buy these.

Great buy

I keep gloves on hand for art projects, cleaning, yardwork, poop scooping and medical issues.These work well and are durable. I took one star away because I feel they run a little small. Yet I would purchase these again but maybe in the large size.

Perfect for around the house for cleaning and food prep. If you pull too hard putting them on, they will rip and you do need dry hands to put them on just as with all disposable gloves (that I’ve tried).  However once on, I have prepped food, cleaned -  including dirty window tracks, and dyed my hair with no rips. I am buying more.

They fit true to size and are durable

Great product at a great price !

I use these when I'm painting with alcohol ink. They help keep my hands from staining!

we are very happy with this product

This how my gloves in the box.

These were of a much better quality than I expected. They are much thicker

The gloves stay on and hold up to the task at hand. I've used the gloves to protect my hands while scrubbing, gardening, and picking up trash in the neighborhood. My only complaint is that the first few gloves came out in a bunch.  But after that they came out one at a time.

I have used these gloves many times and they are great for basic house chores.  They are also good for handling food when you are using a sauce or soaking food overnight and the food has to be turned over.

Of all the different brands of disposable gloves I have tried so far these are my favorite.  They fit well and are comfortable, easy to put on and very sturdy.  I have not had any issues with tearing like i have with others.  They are the perfect thickness.  I use them primarily for cooking and cleaning.

Fits well

These gloves are thick and can take a beating like in the kitchen since I use it to cut food and vegetables, taking out items to the garbage. As a caregiver, I use it to clean my mom and they really are tough while I am getting my mom cleaned as a baby's bottom. I believe only one pair did ripped except it was the bottom band that wraps around the wrist.

These gloves run small and tear easily unfortunately I bought more than one box I will never buy them again durability is a rip when you go to put them on but maybe that’s because they run so small

I am very pleased with these vinyl gloves.  It is my 2nd box and I would order them again.They are a good price for 100 gloves and the medium fit is perfect.  They are easy to accessfrom the box.  I use them for everything from house cleaning to handling my pet's food.I also appreciated the quick delivery.

I read City of Dread and liked it very much.  Not only a fascianting mystery, but also some of the history of the time setting.  I recommend it.  I think you will like it too.

Does the job

This is a great product for the money!  I use them for a variety of projects!

I love to cook and I’m allergic to latex products so these were perfect. My hands are a bit small but I like the size of the gloves.

Did not care for this brand and I will stick with Amex. I ordered two boxes and the gloves were very difficult to get out of the box. I tore both boxes and had to put the gloves in a storage bag

Purchased this product for office staff almost two months ago.  There have been zero complaints.  I do not expect anything to be complaint free from a busy staff but this product has drawn zero complaints.  From my point of view, this is the best there is.

The gloves fit better than expected. They definitely are better than those one-size-fits-all disposable gloves... they fit snug, but not tight, at the wrist, perfect for food preparation and for use when cleaning with products that you don’t want all over your hands. I definitely recommend.

I am always doing food prep and especially with the pandemic wanted to make sure my hands are covered at all times when touching other peoples food.  These gloves are strong and don't break like other gloves do.

Nothing to add here.

Great size, great value.

Have been using these gloves for a long time and have never been disappointed.

Good for the price.

I was satisfied with the product but the delivery was bad. The product came 3 days late

Like the product. I used to apply pain medication.

These gloves were very reasonable, and come with plentybin the box.  Size medium was a perfect fit for my hands, and they are durable

They are just what I was looking for.

Wasn't sure which size to get because previous gloves used were one size.  I ordered Medium and it's a good fit for someone with small to medium hands.  Thickness is good and quality of gloves.  Used for foods, cleaning and using creams.

good product, fit well, would order again.

Has enough stretch for a good fit.  I use them inside and out.  Priced better than others.  I have small hands,but medium fits me good.

These gloves fit exactly as expected.  They are heavy duty as stated and every bit as good as the name brand I had before I bought these.

Weve been ordering these gloves for a few months and I like that there is minimal tears. When there is, its usually around the wrist area. I've tried other brands that are more expensive but quality and durability are poor compared to these.

Care givers are happy with this product.

Was worried about the fit and thickness. These gloves are perfect. Good fit, better thickness than my other vinyl gloves. I use them when cooking, for handling and preparing meat. I keep a box at the barn. Very durable for putting meds on thrushy hooves. Very comfortable too. I recommend them.

No issues, work well. Sometimes they rip around the wrist when I try to take them off but no biggie

With gloves in such scarcity in healthcare, it has been a relief to receive relatively large deliveries of gloves, at a decent price, and within 1-2 days of ordering.  It has really helped our office when no other sources are available.

"The media could not be loaded.So far so good. Just need the gloves for sanitizing around the house. The size large in most are too big for me, so I am happy with the fit."

With the COVID issues it has been difficult to find disposable gloves in local stores. So thankful to find these gloves on Amazon! This was a new brand for me, but they are great. Very pleased with this product and plan to continue purchasing them in the future.

These hold up well and fit nicely. I have slightly larger than average hands for a women and the size is comfortable

Easy to use. Good durability. Good price.

I used the gloves to bathe and clean a patient. They never ripped.

The one thing i got to say is everytime ive pulled the box out of the packaging its all ripped apart. Im sure just happens in transit i just tape the box up and its as good as new.

Good value for what I paid. I can't keep track, but this must have been, at least, my fifth box. I am a cashier and wear them daily at work since the pandemic.

These comfortable gloves fit perfectly and never rip as I'm working.

They protect my hands well when I do unpleasant chores, like scooping the litter box.  I am on immune suppressant meds so have to be careful of germs. I wear them when I go into a grocery store as also along with my mask. I recommend  this product.  They work very well.

Great value for these gloves.

I like these gloves, bought a medium for me perfect fit, I use them to medicate my Cat so this size box allows me to always have them, the snug fit also helps in medicating.

Product it's good for the purpose. Product was received but I was not aware of it.

Use for household chores/ very satisfied

Did what it’s supposed to do. Second time I bought this brand. Works well.

This are a nice barrier from epoxy and other harsh chemicals. I wish I had sized up but otherwise I like the gloves

These gloves are reasonably priced, comfortable and durable. This is the third time that I’ve ordered them. I would definitely recommend them.

Great product!!!

The comfort and durability were most important to me and they have not failed me yet.

I love everything about these. Sent pics to my sisters so they can buy them too!!

Made very well, and I would purchase again. Please keep the cost as is. Thank you!

I use these gloves to apply a transdermal gel to my cat's ear twice daily. These gloves are sturdy but then enough I can see through them and feel what I am applying so that I know when I have it absorbed into his ear flap.

I bought them for COVID safety. But I also started to use them for cooking and cleaning as well. They are very durable and good.

Comfort and safety, they are very durable and very reasonably priced. In this time we are in better  safe than sorry I recommend this product.

Really like these gloves ,they are easy to put on and easy to take off.  They do not clink to your hands like other latex glove and very comfortable to wear.

These have been used around the house and for the kitchen. No complaints and they have not ripped or worn once. Very comfortable and fits really well on my hands.

The gloves fit me perfectly and are very easy to get on and off.  I use them for various uses around the house and checking the batteries on my golf cart.

This exactly what I expected. Next time I will order a large. The medium is just the smallest bit too small. Though I'm not sure. I'd rather this fit than a bit too big. I am a woman 5'10 and hands larger than a 5'2 woman....

These were exactly what as expected

This was my first purchase of disposal gloves. I decided to try these gloves to begin a rebuild/restore of a vintage motorcycle. With the amount of wrenching, handling, part prep, painting, and assembly involved, I thought I'd try  to use these gloves to protect my hands to some degree. I was pleasantly surprised to find that at each stage of the rebuild and day of work. the gloves would come off, and I found my hands clean, and without grease or paint stains, etc...!! it was awesome...!! Good Job KCH Corp.

Good Product - great buy

I like to use them to keep my hands clean while working on dirty projects

-they run a little small, so I ordered medium...also, they cost a lot less now than curing COVID!

I really like these gloves.These latex free gloves are outstanding. I intend to keep buying them through Amazon as I trust this company very much. I would recommend these gloves everybody that wanted to get latex free gloves because they are really great.

Use these when I need to make meatballs or if I’m cutting chiles, works wonders don’t know why I never got these before

The size and comfort of these are awesome.

Due to the current environmental situations I am wearing gloves when I leave my home just to err on the side of caution. These gloves are good and I can get them next day with Prime if I find myself running low.

Household cleaning and purchasing and pumping gas,

I like the fact that they are size it’s suppose to be. They don’t fit big. Their not thick but just fine where they don’t tear.

Perfect fit and it’s a great feel to your hands.  Absolutely great 👍🏼

We are doing hospice care for my mother-in-law in our home. These gloves fit the bill perfectly. I am sure I will have other uses for them later.

The nitrate/vinyl gloves I have been buying were not available so decided to try another product line. I’m so happy with this product that I’ll be re-ordering these instead of the others.

I use these gloves to wipe down door handles and such during the lock down.  I find them up to the task and comfortable.

True to size and comfortable

I have to buy these cause my job don’t offer med gloves. These are very good gloves. Have not had a issue with them yet.

Had nitrile before large and decided to be more realistic on personal protection during these challenging times. Went with medium. Perfect fit and saved some money also.

Great product! Buying it once a month. Usually, use it in the kitchen while cooking or cleaning the house.

I keep these in the car for pumping gas. They are great quality for what I need

Very good thickness so does not rip, tear or break open. Use to keep hands protected while changing Depends of family member.

Helped protect hands when cleaning and during covid

When the girls  would put them on they would break.

hard to find locally . i was hesitant at buying online but they are good quality. buy them now !

Good gloves, don’t tear, thicker than other gloves I’ve used.

SIZE UP!  I normally wear a small (I am under 5' tall with small hands) but I read the reviews and ordered a medium and am glad I did.

Good price, not too thick orthin

Perfect fit, comfortable and durable! We needed these in order to show a house and everyone who wore them had no issue or discomfort☺️

These gloves are just what I was looking for.  I use them for many things, mostly in the kitchen.  They fit nice on the hand and don't feel like they are going to fall off.

Fits and feels like I thought.I have fairly small men’s hands and they fit as expected.

These are single use vinyl gloves.  So far no bad ones in the box and they do what they're supposed to.  They have the durability I expect, which isn't much.

Durable, but be easy pulling them in from the rim. I've had several tear on me. Otherwise, they do their job.

Very pleased with these gloves. Fits well and not too thick for my uses. This is my 3rd box and sure I will be purchasing more in the future.

Great. They get the job done!

I love using these gloves when cooking/baking foods that involve getting my hands messy. I can take old ones off after handling a meat and put on a clean pair to handle something else without washing my hands between each little task. Only downfall is they seem to start peeling a little when using certain products so be cautious not to get residue in the foods.

Medium size is perfect.  I use for food prep and these slip on and off easily.

These gloves are great for food prep. They are thin enough to be comfortable but thick enough to use without fear of breaking.

I wear these when I need to cut peppers. They are very effective at keeping the skin from absorbing capsaicin.

Perfect fit, durable, comfortable. Medium fits me perfectly, while medium in different brand was slightly loose. So if you’re between Medium and Large, I’d size up

The gloves fit snugly and are just what I needed to accomplish my work.

Not the most durable gloves but they get the job done and for a great price.

I like it I use it to wash dishes.

They are great for food prep. A good price too.

These are great for short duration when you know you will discard them very quickly. A great bargain. Not for long term use when you want more grip.

As I have a food allergy-peanut products-even making a sandwich for the grandkids can be dangerous for me!  So, I was super-excited to find disposal gloves for sale once again on Amazon!

slightly big next time will go with a small- I use for work with all the covid going around

The gloves fit well and the material is good. I will buy again soon, as it took a while to get them here, and it seems that they will be needed for quite some. I am very pleased with the product.

These gloves were just as I wanted.  They fit my hands so it is easy to work with them.  They are thick but easy to get off.

General work is the use for these. They aren’t really thick but for their thickness they are strong

Last along time.

They’re fine for cleaning bathrooms but tear easily if used while scrubbing dirty pots or cleaning oven.

This is my second box of gloves.  Goes on easily and never tares.  Good product.

Could not find in stores so I purchased these. They are just as good as serve the purpose for what my home needs them for. Would order from seller again.

Exactly as described.  This is my 2nd order. I will continue to order these gloves.

I liked the fit

I bought these for school. The box came undamaged and the gloves are durable and fit well.

I use these gloves when prepping food, cleaning and washing dishes. They never get holes in them. They are the perfect fit.

I have very small hands yet this size medium fits perfect. Fyi....

Go a size up

i like the fitting it fits so well in my hands.

Good product

Bought these to epoxy tumblers and they work great.  Fast shipping and product as described

Because I ordered powder free they are a little less easy to get on or off, but not enough to prevent me from ordering them again when I need gloves.

The med  was all they had. They worked but were too right. I got a large and they are perfect.

I mean,  they are gloves 🤷🏿‍♀️Very fast shipping.. they are a bit bigger for my hands but overall I like them.

Good material. Easy to wear.  Durable

Good fit. Good weight.

Just as described

Purchased these gloves for esthetician school. They definitely serve their purpose.

thicker than the ones available at costco. Less likely to rip.

Much more durable than I first thought they would be.  Good for cleaning. Gardening & yard work as well as bacteria ‘ virus control.

This product was a great purchase as it meets my needs in keeping my hands clean as I wipe down surfaces in my classroom.

Good price

I have ordered before. These are for use in the kitchen and work very well.

These gloves are great for every day use  from handling raw food and quick cleaning and disinfecting the bathrooms and other areas around the house.

Suitable for light cleaning.  Great for Cronus 19 protection, ie shopper, filling veh at gas station, touchable items at work, DO NOT STRETCH MUCH, so buy your size or one size up !!

I use them when changing my special needs daughter.

worked out fine

The gloves fit great but they rip easy!

easy to pull on and off

Prompt service.  I like the thickness and comfort of these gloves.  I would order them again.

Good quality gloves. Little thin but that’s fine for me. I do cook a lot and will use them while working in the kitchen.

If my wife says these are the ones, I trust her.

Great gloves! Will buy again

Great value

They fit great and I have many uses for hem, even my crafts. Thank you.

These function as they should.  They are durable, yet comfortable.

These are the only things that will work with me making cups and don’t break thick and comfy

The gloves didn't come high enough on my wrist.

These disposable gloves do the job they were bought for. they are strong.

They are perfect for around the house jobs . I also use when I go shopping to help fight germs that may be lurking

Great durability and thickness. Easy for my son to wear too.

These gloves were just what I was looking for. I'll be using them for household applications.

These gloves were exactly what I was looking for.  I will be ordering more.  We use them to clean our cat boxes.  They protect our hands from germs that might get into any cut we might be unaware of on our hands.  I only ordered one box initially to make sure they were what I wanted and they are.

Why

Received in one day. Gloves are very comfortable on your skin.

Great to have around the house for cleaning, hair dyeing, or to keep the cooties off when you go out during a pandemic (with proper usage, of course).

Delivered on time, good fit, will buy again

Makes me feel safer when I go the grocery or hardware stores.  Will reorder, when needed..

I love these gloves. They are longer and are durable

I use these gloves for cleaning, and shopping to protect my hands from germs.

Good gloves would buy them again

If you have an allergy to latex these definitely work. No reaction after using these gloves. They are thin but definitely work.

Fast shipping!

Wears well.

Just your run-of-the-mill disposable gloves. I like them because they’re not powdery and fit nice

Bueno

Good quality. Worth buying.

The gloves were smaller than I expected. Overall, it's a great product for the price.

They work great.  Do exactly what they are suppose to do.

Great fit!

Works as expected

Great fit. Necessary due to latex allergy

nice product.

Good product..

Perfect

I bought the gloves for covid-19 protection. Since I read the reviews before purchasing I knew I needed to purchase a larger size. I'm glad I did! I usually buy large gloves but I knew my husband wouldn't be able to fit them so I ordered an XL. They are alittle big for me but not by much plus they fit my husband's hands. So no complaints here.  I'm happy with my purchase!

These are a perfect fit.  I got the Large which is my normal size.  I have average size hands but usually get a Large for comfort reasons and easy on and off.  These are great, no powder, clear and stay on well and don’t smell. They arrived quickly and I really needed them!

FITS WELL, NOT TOO THICK

I recently had Covid.  I bought these gloves so I could clean up around the house when family was not present.  I have small hands but ordered a medium.  These were thicker than I thought.  They were easy to put on.  I saw some reviews said they ripped but I never had an issue with that.  They also arrived in great condition.  I know some mentioned their gloves were damaged when received but I didn’t have that problem either.  These held up very well!  I was happy and they gave me peace of mind while cleaning.  Great gloves!

Second time I bought these gloves. They are a good thickness and I have not had any rip when putting on. I use mainly for food prep. I would recommend this product.

I purchased these to have in the kitchen for some of the jobs I get using bare hands for (working with chicken, jalapeños, that sort of thing). These are perfect for what I needed!

I use these a lot with my horse.  Lot's of ointments necessary when you have a horse.

After Covid I realized the many uses for these gloves. The ones that come with hair dye are flimsy This brand is strong and fits your hand well

Excellent quality.  Gets the job done.  I always buy these gloves.  Highly recommend.

Durable, comfortable and great value

I am in nursing and allergic to latex.  So, these are great, price, fit and use.  Thank You!

I wear gloves for almost all my daily activities because of severe allergic dermatitis. These gloves fit me well, are durable and seem to be a good value in our current economy.

Use glove for germs.

As advertised works well

Very durable. Would recommend getting a bigger size.

Buy these!

Came quick and do the job

good

good value

Applying ointment to skin

I am someone who dyes their hair a lot. I am also someone who likes to be as clean as possible while dying my hair. Gloves are a big part of that and for me these are perfect for that.

Good value and product is as described

Love them

Use for multi chores

These do the job

The fit was good not too tight and went on/off easy.

Many gloves but not as you would expect from normal gloves.

They work

Rady and durable

These gloves are a great fit and are very comfortable. Stretchy, not the ones that aren’t elastic and have no give. Will buy again!

These are good gloves for durability, comfort, and value for your money.

Comfortable and durable

Comfort and value for money

Needed and found it to be  a good value.  Happy to have found these on the internet.

Using it for my resin epoxy pouring,  love them

They are durable and fit well

NA

great gloves. use them when i shop in the supermarket. also around the house. they hold up well. sturdy. will buy again.

was surprised at how easy they can be put on and they don't slide off

Good for the price

I read the other reviews that said they run very small, so instead of buying my usual size S, i ordered a medium & they fit perfect.They work exactly as gloves should (no better, no worse), i use them to cut citrus at my bartending job- i can usually even take then off between customers & put them back on to finish.If needed I'd def buy these again

I love it and I will order this again

Great product

Good

Great box of disposable gloves. I use for home Healthcare. Fit nicley and does not tear while using like some gloves I've purchased from different retailers. Thank you! Would definitely recommend!

It is good as expected

We use these gloves to administer PCR COVID-19 test.

Good price, good product.

I use these gloves under my garden gloves to keep my hands from getting dirty.  Also for yucky cleanups… hamster cage, cat vomit, etc.  Meet all my needs.

I love these gloves and use them for a number of jobs around the house.  These fit great, and are wonderful quality.  Highly recommend!

Good quality gloves

Good

These run a little small so if you're unsure if you should get a medium or large, go for the large. I have small hands and the medium fits me perfectly. I use it when I paint. They're great.

I think these disposal vinyl gloves are a good deal for the money.

Nice gloves and suit the purpose

I run an Airbnb and I use these to clean. They aren't too heavy or too light and they seem to be very durable.  Would have liked for them to be less expensive but I guess everybody has raised their prices no matter what they are selling.

Good product. Excellent shipping time.

Works fine. Comfortable

Easy to slip on.feels natural

My husband's CNA requested these gloves.  Great fit and last during different chores.

Just what I needed for cleaning and getting gas. I would recommend. Thank you.

I bought these because of COVID-19 so when I go to stores I’m not touching surfaces with my hands and these are great because you can use them on touch screens.

Latex-free, fits well and easy to put on and take off. I use them to keep the resin epoxy of my hands and when I color my hair. Just be careful putting them on because my thumb sometimes pops through them if I pull to hard. Otherwise they are great.

Durabity is good. Nurses are wearing these gloves as they screen worshipers temperatures.

This is very useful disposal gloves for daily use around house!

Great product. Fitted as expected.

And break easily

😍

If you have animals these gloves are great for picking up pet hair and cheap enough to use one and throw them away .  They  are also for many other house projects inside and outside the house

I Wear it to clean up my dishes.Protect my skin from soaps!So comfortable to wear it and working around.

What can I say they are vinyl gloves. They are quality gloves with a sturdy thickness. I use them for prepping food like chicken, and other meats. I buy frozen vegetables in bulk and use the gloves when I sort the veggies into meal size portions. I use them when I wash and condition my hair. I use them when I’m cleaning the house for light duty.

This is used to replenish our student clinic supplies and First aid kits

These worked well for me.

fit well, well packaged, protected my families and i's hands when needed and were as comfortable as gloves can be!

I use these gloves for many things but especially during flu and allergy seasons.  I open doors, use shopping carts, touch clothing and money, etc. and have no idea what germs are on them.  When the weather gets cold I can wear other washable gloves but during the Fall and early Spring it looks strange to wear those types of gloves. These are perfect for wearing to go shopping and they are so affordable I don't feel guilty for disposing of them after I get home.

They fit perfect & don’t make my hand sweat. I just use them for when I clean my house.

Not bad, I’m satisfied.

These are great! Very strong and doesn't rip!

Latex free

Thick and durable

Fair food preparation

Just what we needed for protection from COVID

Positively  no Problems or issues with this product

Good glove.  I use for pumping gas

My wife uses them to clean with

Definitely buying them again after that box comes to an end! I use them for kitchen food purposes and they’re durable and comfortable

I bought this gloves to paint our home, good price the Lowe’s and HD :)

Good value for the amount of gloves... I use them for everything

I like the price.  I got them for using while canning.

Love them

These are nice gloves. They fit really good and they are very durable. At a few cents each they are definitely worth the money bibs used then to clean, garden and bake.

Pretty durable

As advertised

fits tight. i bought M i have small hands.other than that is great value

We rely on these to change my father's briefs. They HAVE to be good quality and they are.

Ordered these in hopes that they would save my hands from harsh cleaning chemicals. They are great! Highly recommend them for light cleaning. Not a garden glove though.

Good

These gloves are great for all kinds of household and personal things. Great price, too.

They fit my hands very well. Wish the length was a little longer but very satisfied.

Great value for the money

They're not nitrile gloves because pandemic, supply and demand, whatev but they work for crafts without breaking out the Black Credit Card because people are price gouging the nitrile gloves.  But I digress.

I use them when pumping gas and I use them when handling all kinds of meat.

Great for cleaning, will purchase again. Medium size fits perfectly

As a professional House Keeper with sensitive skin, I wear these over-latex dishwashing gloves and my hands are safe.

Little tight fit for a medium size

These are perfect for our high risk home to have sitting at the front door for guests and even better to use when cleaning,  which we do A LOT of. Worth the money. Will buy again.

Great fit for my hands. Very durable and well-fitting, and they feel good too even after an hour or more. I have not had one break on me whilst doing tasks that involve dirt and grease, I.E. when you really want them to keep your hands clean.

Great

comodidad

Better glove than those costing more

Work as expected.

These gloves are easy to wear and I love them when I am prepping in the kitchen.

Exactly what I expect and what they described

Have ordered product a couple of times so obviously am satisfied. Fair price, size is good, will order once again. Delivered on time. Dependable.

Wasn't looking to break the bank , they do the job for me and then just toss em. All depends on what you're looking for. Recommend

Muy importante para mi uso diario de limpieza.

As advertised

I have tried a couple of different brands and I find these the best so far. They are super easy to put on as well as take off. The only thing I would suggest to the seller is don't pack them so tight in the box. I think what happens is for some people saying they tear is because they are a bit difficult to get out of the box. Another favorite of mine is the purple gloves.

Durable sturdy perfect no rip no tears and I have long acrylics easy to clean I use them on clients for facials

They could be a bit pricey but they're comfortable to me and can write on my phone with the gloves on, which is important to me. Thank you Amazon 😁😁

Quality

The nurses that take care of my husband like them.

Great product

Protects my hands from cleaning products

Really good quality gloves!

Bought these for a Printmedia class. They've been working well so far. Not too thick, but not too thin. They're clear. Fit just right. Rubbery, and comfortable. Haven't broken any yet. No powder. Good quality disposable gloves.

We go there a ton in caring for me. I’m disabled. They do not need to be durable as they get changed often.

The gloves fit great for my caregiver and I  who work in an adult foster home. Thank you for the fast delivery time,and good product. Kim

Durable gloves

Use daily to care for elderly client.

Great for party bags - but make sure to order enough: my set came with a broken  one. I don’t know if it’s easy to clean (asked that I rate that)

Yes, I need to get a manicure but, you’re welcome for the picture 😂

I am not sure about the stretch or scent.They were convenient to put into goodie bags as a favor.

I didn’t expect for them toBe so small otherwise they are very cute just really  tiny but I suppose that’s why they are so small because they are only favors

I got these for my classroom. I am picky about the slime we bring in... as so much of it sticks to the clothing.This was fun... they loved it... until we opened the balls and they just smashed it into tiny pieces of disappointment. I was sad...But then I just kept mindlessly playing with it and realized you have to really work the stuff together to make it malleable. The colors of course mix together more... which is probably why it's not as processed as it should be, to keep the colors clearer.Anyway, just in case anyone else had that issue.

Bought these to stick in kids gift boxes for a birthday party. The containers were a little smaller than I imaged they'd be, but the kids enjoyed them and thats what matters!

I am using this as part of my daughters birthday goodie bags to her friends. I love the small individual containers. Perfect for what I need. The colors are amazing, very cool to look at and touch. One negative thing i just say is when I pulled the slime apart just playing with it, small peices started clinging to my hands. And everywhere else. Washed right off though. Will be a hit at her birthday im sure.

This product is not very slime like, but the kids still liked it. It’s more like a squishy moldable play gel. If you try to stretch it, it breaks apart rather than stretch. Overall, nice product. The colors are super cool. But if your looking for good slime, this is not the stuff.

I had a kids outdoor movie night. This was put in the goody bags. I just thought they were a little bigger. Other than that they were a good buy

There were a hit as party favors. There is a strong, overwhelming anatomy lab, embalming smell. Being in science I am somewhat used to it, but if you are not into strong chemical smells this might not be the product for you.

Got these as party favors for my daughters 3rd bday party unicorn theme and they came in a box wrapped individually and the varieties was awesome! They were perfect fit with the other party favors and the kids LOVED IT!!! The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is cuz it is messy and hard to get out of hair, carpet which happened! UGH but honestly is there a slime that isn't messy??? HAHA great though!

Gave these to my coworkers for the holidays.  They become unusable very quickly when played with consistently.  We got 2-3 days of continuous use.  Do not leave sticky residue on hands or surface.  It was worth it.  We all enjoyed them.  Only complaint was how quickly they "died" and the odd smell

The cups are really small, but for the price, worth it for party favors.

Great value for end of year third grade gift bags

Really nice balls of slime. I love that it comes with some clear slimes with decorations in them. These would be perfect as party favors.The slime does have to be worked a bit more than other slime to become a more slime-like consistency.

Great value for the money,

Well packaged.  None were leaking or damaged - all tightly closed with plastic seal.  Good variety for boys and girls. My daughter gave these as a stocking stuffer to her 2nd grade class.  They were well liked.

Forget all about slime.

Great gifts for kids

much smaller than I expected.

N/a

This was perfect, it was for my sons birthday party and the kids loved it. it wasnt as messy as most slime which is what I love most about it.

Several typos on the box really scared me, but this is actually pretty decent slime-not terribly messy! The packs are sort of small though.

I ordered for my girl's birthday and they loved it.Package is good and each slime has different cute things in it!

The slime breaks apart to easily and I was missing one when packages arrived. Kids don’t seem to mind it but I won’t be buying this again.

It's good, just that it is pretty hard to stretch but it's ok. My 10 years old  love it.

Very watery slime. Also thought they would be bigger

Kids love it. There was one with little toy duckies in it. Pretty fun.

Mess free and fun for kids

Last year I ordered galaxy slime for kids Halloween goodies, but not this one. I read the informations that seller wrote before bought it. It is the same as advertised. It is very tiny slime! So it will easy to clean if it dropped( because it is tiny). It is great for little kids and family(that not slime fan!!).For me, It is value the money because I got 24 slime to put in little kids Halloween goodies bags.

Colorful and fun but smaller than I expected

I expected the cups containing the slime to be somewhat bigger then what they are. Nice size for little hands. good gift for gift bags for a birthday party. easy to clean up, stretches real far. dropped on carpet and did not do anything to the carpet.

The tubes were smaller than I would have liked. But it was a good party favor.

Just be careful putting them on as they will tear if you jam your hand in too quickly.

The wrist part ripped on me while I was putting a few of them on but all in all, decent quality and they keep my hands protected when I use them when I spray any chemicals.

good for the price

Good product and very good price.

Pros: I loved the latex-free material, because I am allergy to rubber, and had no issue with these gloves;Cons: bare nails were required to avoid puncturing the gloves; the box came extruded.

These gloves are great for the money, really nothing else to say. They work for me

They do the trick, but definitely don’t fit. So if you need to do delicate work I would not buy these. They are nothing like gloves that nurse doctors veterinarians healthcare workers use.

Satisfied

Don’t fit too comfortably, but it’s fine

Nothing special about them. There is not much stretch to them and they’re a bit difficult to put on because of this. If they were more expensive I would have returned them.

These are inexpensive, throw-away gloves, meant to keep you from touching germs and from your germs touching other things and people.For that purpose, they work well. They go on the hand without tearing. They will allow you to perform simple tasks like handling food or dyes--or shopping during a pandemic--and then you throw them away.I have not experienced improper sizing (large hands--like many men--wear large; smaller hands--like many women--wear medium; small hands--like smaller women and children--wear small). And I have even re-used them by washing them out after a light use, and they held up to multiple wears (even though they are not intended for this). So I have no complaints.Do I wish they were less expensive? Absolutely. But they work. And I'm glad to have them.

I would order a size down. They are very durable to use while cooking or anything you need to use them for.

They are plastic gloves and come in handy in greenhouse and changing oil and fluids on tractor. Messy stuff. *they are not sterileOr surgical

I need to use these types of gloves for every day housework, since I have skin tenderness and right now in Covid climate.  They work OK, but are very thin, so don't pull too hard when you are taking them out of the box, or putting them on your hands.  Otherwise they work fine.THE DELIVERER NEVER RANG THE BELL for our SECURITY DOOR AT OUR CONDO-- OUR NAME IS IN CAPITAL LETTERS AND VERY AVAILABLE- but the DELIVERER NEVER RANG THE BELL-- FRUSTRATING_ GOES AGAINST MY DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS. Why am I supposed to give Delivery Instructions if they are NEVER DONE??

Comfortable, good for quick clean ups!!

Worked well while doing general cleaning, painting and staining. Priced well for a disposable item

I wasn't paying attention and ordered medium gloves instead of large. I mainly use them to avoid getting possible covid on my hands while I'm out taking care of business.  They're snug, but it's good to be careful putting them on so they don't tear. Otherwise they're pretty sturdy. Unless you smoke. Your lighter might get too close or if you're clumsy your cigarette. You'll get a hole. I haven't tried to find a flashpoint. Just be careful around flame.

It is useful for what I intend to use it for. Is minor protection of my hands

Overall, they basically get the job done. I work for Instacart, and I wear gloves so I'm not touching produce and such with my bare hands.I'd say about 40% of the time, the gloves rip in some fashion within 30 minutes of basic usage. That number jumps up to 100% if your hands are wet when you try to put them on. Instant rip at the wrist. I wouldn't recommend these for anything other than short temporary uses honestly. But like I said, still get mostly get the job done

My hands aren't really large, but these are a bit too snug, and too easy to tear at the wrist if not careful putting them on.  I have taken to pre-inflating them, which helps.  But for even "average" sized male hands, the large size is better.  They provide a suitable barrier for food-handling or coming into contact with possibly-contaminated surfaces, but even moderate force or roughness in handling everyday items that do not have smooth edges, (such as picking up a feed bag or a box of groceries) can tear them.  Used with care, they are fit for purpose.

These are alright. I had a couple of them break trying to get on but once I had a pair on they were good only need to put color in my hair, went a little crazy during the Covid and decided to die my hair teal, since I am not working my normal job I could get away with it. Though I don’t think I am going to go through the pain of doing that again so I have no idea what I am going to do with the rest of this box

Serves the purpose well. I have never used vinyl exam gloves before always used latex but since the pandemic price was set soo high by manufacturers because of high demand! They have quadrupled in price and that is ridiculous. Those vinyl gloves tear real easy at the cuff but for my purpose I’m satisfied. They can keep the latex gloves!!

This are really good gloves and reasonably priced. I will definitely buy them again

Works as expected.

For cleaning.

This is a quick and easy way to ensure cleanliness and contamination when preparing food.

Decent for the price. They get the job done.

These gloves are not as thick and durable as blue nitrile gloves but they are currently less expensive than blue nitrile gloves and they work well.  I use them for cleaning my cat's litter box, covering my hands when I'm out shopping or riding in a cab, handling food.Overall, I do recommend them.

Durability, easy to get gloves out.Great for baking and food handling. Runs a little big, but I have short fingers - nbd. I hate handling sticky dough, so they are perfect for that job.

Bought this for changing my mother’s colostomy as difficult to find medical gloves at a reasonable price and I cannot stomach doing without for that caregiving task. Just fits my size 7 hands and a bit thin but so happy to have regardless!  The seller delivered fast and I’m very appreciative of their great communication!

Taking one star off because this is what I ordered, but I received size large, dark purple, powder-free nitrile gloves. They're fine for my purposes (and probably normally more expensive that the advertised gloves), so this is just an FYI.

My hands are extremely sensitive to handsoap, especially during the Winter and if my hands are covered in anything, even food.  I have found these to work well for just about any use.  They go on easy, come off just as easy, are clear, and I observe no residue.  For the price they cost about as much as a week's worth of handsoap and last about as long.  I buy them so often now they started selling them in two packs.  They are practically a narcotic for me.  I don't like to suffer even one day of washing my hands anymore.Only downside: need better packaging.  They explode out when you pull on the first one.

I use these for cooking.  (Hate working with raw meat without gloves.) Huge pack - decent value for money.(Although I've noticed that all of these glove packages have increased in price since COVID.

The medium gloves didn't fit, too tight. Probably needed a large or a different kind. Very comfortable even though it didn't fit and powder free was a plus. I use these on my job. My co worker needs medium size so I'm give it to her.

They aren't the most durable things ever, but they work for the random stuff I use it for around the house. Cleaning the bathroom and keeping my hands clean on weekend warrior projects, etc..

If you need to order a box of gloves quickly, this isn't a bad choice, easy to get on, comfortable to work with, they're a little short though, but otherwise, they are pretty decent gloves.

Box was open. It’s very easy to tearing up on the top when you putting it on so you have to take your time and put it on very gentle.

Good and durable

They are a little tight for the size on the box. I wouldn't buy these at the same time you purchase large trash bags, zip ties, and lots of cleaning products. It'll get you on a list some where for sure

I like the gloves but feel they run a little small compared to other gloves I have ordered.  Next time I will order Large instead of medium.

I do a lot of staining and painting in our workshop. I got tired of using husbands large gloves so I bought these. They worked great!!

These are fine gloves. They don’t really fit my hands too well, but they do the job. They are pretty thick but are a bit fragile and tear easily. I would buy these again however bc they were good for the price.

These tear most of the time i wear them.

Work well, fit perfectly for me, but the fingertips tend to tear easily for me even with short nails.

I got these for doing household chores.  They are thinner than I would like as they tear easily if you're scrubbing too hard.  However, good value for very lightweight use.

Love for cleaning and preparing food my hands dont get dirty or sticky very comfortable fit well

I like the fact that they are latex free and no powder. We are putting gloves on taking clubs off all day long. Some of the staff finger nails  are getting damaged from wearing the previous gloves. Not a problem here.

Size Medium- fit was accurate, quality decent for price. would buy again due to cheap price

I have a small hand, but ordered the medium since that always worked with a similar product. It was disappointing to find that the gloves are too snug. They do go on, but I prefer a loose fit so as to be able to remove them properly. Otherwise fine.

I use these gloves for chemical cleaning (bleach mix, etc), washing dishes, and handling meats.  Good fit at the fingers/thumbs although a tad loose around the wrist.  Not a real problem as I don't submerge my hands in deep water or cleansers.  Ideal for handling meats!

Nice gloves, but like all gloves on the market due to Covid, they are overpriced.  One of the better priced gloves that I could find on Amazon though.

Not for a heavy duty job, but good for medium around the house jobs.  I keep a box on hand at all times

Very thin material…

Gloves are comfortable but often tear when putting them on.  Once they are on they are fine. Seems to rip at the wrist. If you are careful putting them on you are good. Value is good except for the wasted gloves that ripped.

the box did not dispense gloves one at a time they came out in bunches I had to put them in another container

These are like food handler gloves. Serves my purpose fine, protection for grocery shopping out there during this pandemic, and when when doing cleaning chores.  The medium is slightly big but works. I would buy again.

The gloves fit comfortable. Wore them the next day. I have small hands and product ordered were a medium. Fit nicely. Very satisfied with item. Would order again. The pricing was perfect. Thank you. ME

Good for kitchen use or lite clean up.

These are cheap and do the job.  I can put them on before I go into a store and throw them away when I get back to the car.

They are good for applying insecticide in my garden, although not as durable as I would like.

average product but price has more than doubled since March 2020, price gouging due to pandemic

Pretty durable, not as stretchy as the other gloves like the black ones, but they get the job done!

These gloves do the job. Quality and price are ok for the Covid-19 Era.  The other reviews are right on about the sizes.  They came  "Medium" although I had ordered "large".  Medium is the new small!!

Gloves worked well.  I would order again.

Great item

See below!

Item is fine however I found it on my front lawn almost in the road an wouldn't have known it was there except I went out to get mail.No notice of delivery on my phone.

Durability

Use daily.

They were as described except around the wrist the gloves are very loose fitting.

They fit close and always ripped by the wrist as I was putting them on, but they never tore at the fingers so they kept my hands protected.

Good

personal hygiene

Adequate, useful gloves.

Although the box was somewhat smashed upon delivery the gloves were intact and fit fine,

Very durable than competitors

The medium size barely fits over my hand. Order larger if available.

I work in retail and have to wear these things.

Good product but seem to run a bit small.

Function fine, comfortable. Have a weird mildew odor.

The  Gloves were just as the distributor advertised. They work just fine for my needs thank you will purchase again.

Damaged

really small and hard to put on and offmade for small asian hands? also made my hands sweat :(

Thickness, great product

They were okay, pricey, not as durable as thought.

I think they are top of the line would buy them again.

As advertised

Cost has been driven up unfavorably to consumers

Good for the price. Everything is so expensive now and this are way affordable and useful!

Got this for a family member and they said they are very helpful.

Box came beat up but no gloves exposed

a little on the thinner side but seem to hold up well

The medium for me is a little snug, but still works fine.

Price

Good

Comfortable and no powder.

There was nothing I disliked about the product.

fit fine & work well

What can one say about latex gloves

Happy to have these gloves to wear when shop during the quarantine.

they were tight around my knuckles but overall did the job

Bien

I needed to buy larger size. Great value

not that well made rips easily

Durable

Bien

Reccomend

Ran a bit small with the medium size, but usable.  Will order large next time.

They run small.,

(Size Medium pictured)These gloves are pretty good.  My hand was damp and one glove ripped at the seam on the arm when i pulled it on once, but other than that, they're great to paint in or dye my hair or wash dishes in if I've just done my nails. They're pretty comfortable, I just like the rubber gloves because they fit tighter.

Was initially disappointed in these gloves. Initially I found them to be thin and easily torn-that was my impatience. I like the fit better now and won't go back to a larger size.

Basic gloves that I can use for running errands. Nothing special about them, but they get the job done. Quality is average. A few have ripped upon putting them on.

As I make a small amount of urine at a time, the urinal is too bulky to fit under covers and it spills easily.Make a smaller urinal volume choice.

Ok

They did there job. No complaints

Very good for around the house work and in hair products

A little jammed into the box, but overall good & what I expected.

Good gloves. Not true to size. I’m smallish 5’2”. The mediums barely fit. My child can fit the small size. Buy one size up.

They fit, but they rip easily if you don't don them gently.  I always wear gloves when I chop hot peppers, and these work for what I need.

Not the best but work ok for protection during resining

I do PT custodial work & needed more gloves. They do the trick. Ordered Medium but they run a little bit bigger. I like/need a snug glove & eh, not really a snug fit.

Ordered medium for my small hands and they are tight

Some gloves to tear first time put on. Don’t very durable!!!

Product is fine. Beware of the size however. It is smaller than it would appear.

..as I’ve noticed from other reviews one of slime balls was defected. They didn’t really have much stretch either.

Got this and some of the slime is almost dried out!But I’m not complaining because I throw a lot of slime away! Perfect little doses of slime for younger kids

4 out of the pack had separated and were not usable.

I ordered these without looking at the reviews super closely, which is my mistake. Our package arrived intact, but out of 24, two are completely liquid and not slime at all. I needed all 24, so now I’m stuck trying to find two replacements. That said, the slime seems perfect for our Star Wars party bags but I can’t comment on the actual slime yet as we haven’t opened any of them.

If you want the kind that can stretch and be folded back together, this is not it. It’s got a jello consistency and doesn’t last for more than a 10 min play time. One of the little containers was extremely watery.

My order arrived in tact with all of the slime balls. They look beautiful! There are 18 galaxy slimes and 6 single color slimes with plastic fruits and beads in them. Super cute!However, I opened one up to try it and the quality of the slime is rather low. I was not impressed. It doesn't stretch very far, instead it just kind of breaks. If you warm it up a bit it stretched a bit more but you have to do it very slowly. The colors also mixed together really quickly.On the bright side, it doesn't seem to stick to anything so it's pretty easy to clean up.Overall, I don't think I would buy these again.

Super tiny containers, not what I expected.

It was used for a grab bag gift

it came with more than half of the slimes melted

I bought this for Christmas for my grandson, however I was very disappointed, did not like at all. When we were opening the balls, it was not easy, and the slime was very sticky, had to be very careful to not stick at other things.

Packaged in the product box. It was pretty small but perfect as party favors. Some of them were stretchy and some were really dry. I’d still prefer them over sticky messy slimes.

This product is not the slime that I was expecting.  It feels like jello and breaks apart into pieces.  my daughter didn't like and neither did I.  It's not worth the price and I would not recommend this product to anyone.

They’re what’s advertised except that the slime was old and close to being completely dry.  The slime was not stretchy and slimy like slime is supposed to be. However, my daughter is only three so she didn’t really care, all she does with slime is mix and squish and use it like pretend food and these were good enough for her. But there would have been a lot of disappointed kids had I used this as party treats

"The media could not be loaded.There were 6 clear slime balls in the set, and surprisingly my daughter likes the clear ones more than Galaxy balls. They are so cute to have little figures and fruits confetti inside. My daughter spent quite a long time playing with them. However, I found the clear slime is more watery or liquid than regular ones, so very easy to get sticky on hands. And the ball container is the weak part. It's made of cheap plastic and super easy to get cracked. Once the container got cracked, the slime became dry quickly."

I was a little disappointed because I thought there were 24 galaxy glitter balls. There are 20 included and 4 that are clear with tiny charms inside. I lucked out because we only needed 20 but if I had needed 24 I would have been out of luck. The charms inside the clear balls were so small they would pose a safety hazard for young kids.

"The media could not be loaded.This slime is not slimy does not stretch it’s very stiff and rips apart I do not recommend this product at all! Update: after heating the slime it stretched again. I think this slime is just too cold. It’s not the greatest but i think after it warms up to the air in a warm room it melts better."

I purchased these for a space birthday party. While cute, the tubs are tiny. The entire thing of slime easily fit in my 6-year-old's hand. The kids thought it was cool — it feels awesome — but were soon asking what they were supposed to do with it. It's a fun novelty, but doesn't have the longevity of playdough or some of the other sculpting products. It is very easy to clean up, which is a plus.

Love the galaxy colors. Great for boys and girls. Problem is the box and Amazon both say it's a 24 pack. It is, but inside box there are only 18 galaxy slime and 6 solid girly color ones with little ducks and pearls inside. 24 galaxy pack should be 24 galaxy slime balls, not 18. I'm going to have to make sure the girls only receive the 6 that are not galaxy colors. Frustrating.

Very cute but one came broken. Also, one row was random slime which was not cool cause I needed for all of them to be galaxy themed /:

The slime is watery on the outside and doesn’t stretch like regular slime, but breaks apart instead. Cheaply made, but you get what you pay for...

I would have given this 5 stars because the slime is really cool looking BUT 6 out of the 24 were not the “space” looking slime. 6 of them were solid/clear colors with little pieces of confetti in them. Ok, but not what I ordered. It was for a boys bday party so rubber ducky confetti slime was a little disappointing to the birthday boy

Way, way smaller than I thought they’d be. For those not spatially inclined, here’s a picture to help you out. From the pictures in the advertising, I really thought they’d be bigger. Otherwise, it’s slime.

Got these for my daughters class. They were a cute but were not all stretchy like the girl in the ad pics made it look. They pulled apart in chuncks and you could play with pieces like it was a little dry. Color and glitter were pretty.

Ok item, but they are very small

YOU NEED TO PACKAGE ACCORDING TO THE HEAT OF AZ. THEY WERE SO WATERY YOU COULDN'T PLAY WITH THEM. THE KIDS WERE SAD BECAUSE REALLY COOL COLORS, BUT WAY TO SOFT TO DO ANYTHING.

My students love it.but when they plays with the warmth of their hands melts it and it sticks to the table

Maybe I didn’t read the info close enough but these are TINY! My 10 year old is happy with them, but I think they’re almost too small to be worth getting. Pic attached to show just how small....basically the size of the tip/top of my finger.

"The media could not be loaded.I dont recommend this product because most of the ‘’ slime’’ that I open is not good it doesn’t even look like a slime anymore when I try to stretch it out slowly, it break like a water beads I’m just so disappointed I just waste money"

I bought these for 2-5 yr olds and didn't give them out at a birthday party because it falls apart  in your hand into several pcs and has small beads and shiny glitter in them. I thought it was going to be like clay or putty but its not.

A bit smaller than what I expected.

Iy was smaller than I thought. So I had to buy two. But we put them in a gift bag for 4th graders with a tag that said will you be my valenslime? It was a hit.

They are not all galaxy colors. And the ones that are not of that color are the worse quality ever. almost liquid and sticky.

Supposed to be all galaxy slime balls however arrived with 5 NON GALAXY balls??? The odd balls out aren’t even close to the galaxy theme! They have rubber ducks inside??? How can I use those at a galaxy themed party??

Great colors and packaging, but it doesn’t stretch at all. It just snaps or breaks. I don’t know, maybe i just got an old set. Kind of disappointing.

this is too watery, I even can't touch it. My daugther tried to play with it, but got tired after few attempts.

The product is very small. I do not recommend for childrens younger then 9 years old

Over priced super messy and not easy to play with slime. It is the consistency of germ Ex and if you are familiar with slime sometimes you can work it into thickening up. This stuff not so much. Almost like it got overheated?

Very small container.

Meh...what arrived was not nearly as colorful as shown in the picture on-line. Slime was mixed to point where all balls were just some shade of purple. Disappointed.

Now some spheres contained fun slime and others had the nastiest stickiest glop inside that was partially disintegrated and absolutely no fun!

It is very jiggy. Not much to play with.

They seem great. But they came damaged. Quite a few were broken. Which was disappointing  because I needed all 24!

They seem great. But they came damaged. Quite a few were broken. Which was disappointing  because I needed all 24!

Consistency in sizing and quality lacking within the package.  Some gloves fit well others don’t, a few tore when I was trying to put them on.  Those that fit were fine.

The gloves are fine. The packaging was terrible. The box was bent out of shape and the gloves were very difficult to get out of the box.

I expected the nice thick blue gloves that i got the last time. The also were bigger. The medium is small on my small hands. How can I get the thicker blue ones. I am sending them back.

The only reason I bought these gloves is because the only spray cleaner available during this pandemic at a reasonable price was Clorox Spray with Bleach, which is hard on my hands. I needed a spray cleaner not only to clean, but also to zap the ants that invade annually, since the ant-killer I purchased, which the ants supposed to take back to their nests, attracts the little blighters by the kazillions; they love it so much that they never want to leave; and the only effective ant killers on offer seem to be suffering from the same problem as spray cleaners: difficult to find, except in industrial quantities, and way too expensive!Like the House that Jack built, the Clorox spray killed the ants on contact, and the gloves protected my hands—or I should say 'the *glove* protected my *hand*', because I found it, if not impossible, too much of a hassle, to put on the second glove after I managed to put the first glove on, since these gloves are completely inflexible. Words, in fact, almost fail me to describe these semi-shapeless artefacts.Clunky, lumpy, and blobby, don't quite do the trick, but they're the best I can come up with, since finding the appropriate word is about as annoying as trying to put on the second glove. To think that there are 99 more of them fills me with modified rapture.

After difficulty removing the first few glovesI thought was just too full being a new box. After difficulty continuing, I decided to pull out the gloves to see what the matter was:  they pulled out in one big wad. The wad was turned on it side, so couldn’t pull  them out properly, just had to loosen them all like a bunch of balloons then put in a grocery bag an using them Ike that. Won’t order these again

Bought size medium, but it fits like extra small. Buy at least one and two if possible, size bigger than normal.

These gloves do not have good quality as their elasticity is that great and they do not flex that much. As a result, they can easily get torn while on hands if stretched a little. They are also a little too small. Maybe if they had some powder on them, they might have been easier to use.

Durability not that good

Quality is nice, but the size is too big. I wear a size 7 glove.

Description says heavy duty but they rip a few minutes into some floor tile scrubbing. Overall not bad for the price however.

I like the value but they had the tendency to break when putting them on and no give like normal rubber gloves!!!!

A little too thin for my usage.

There are to many in the small box.  As you pull them out the fingers pull off.  I have wasted at least a dozen gloves so far.

I buy gloves to protect my hands from drying out during the winter months, while doing dishes. They work great for that. They do rip fairly easy. I'd also buy a size larger than you'd typically wear. I usually wear a small, but purchased a medium. The medium fits, but like I said, they can rip pretty easily. Especially if you're trying to force them on.

I use them working with epoxy and there’s nothing heavy duty about these. They break pretty easily but still good gloves.

Order up from your normal size. I wear medium all day at work (hospital). These are tight fit & seem to rip easily for no reason. Maybe if I had more wiggle room they wouldn't rip as easy.

These gloves have a strange fit. Generally, medium size gloves are usually just a little bit loose on my hands but these were really loose, like almost seemed like a large size. And the durability is okay if you get them on your hands without ripping the wrist part of it. Also be aware that they leave a very stinky smell after wearing. Since this is the only box I have purchased I don’t know if all the others would be stinky, but one could assume...

I use these gloves in the kitchen when touching raw meats. I purchased the medium gloves but they fit like small. Other than that they are good to go!

These gloves get holes super easily. My hands usually end up wet underneath while cleaning, cooking etc  unless I double glove.

I like these but sent me the wrong size. I don’t have the time to send them back so whatever lol

I like that they don't leave powder on your hands, not that awful smell you get from latex gloves. However, unlike latex gloves these are kind of loose on your fingers, and have a big part at tips that stays loose and empty.They don't tears as easily as some latex gloves, but are very uncomfortable to work with because of all the extra material at the finger tips.

Size "Medium" was actually  "Small"  when compared to similar gloves I've purchased at Lowes and Home Depot.  Plus, the thickness is thinner than the thickness I expected.  To avoid the humbug of returning the product, I'll just keep it for my wife to use with household chores.  Rarely disappointed with Amazon product; this is the first.

I usually buy the nitrile gloves from Costco but they've been non-existent since Covid happened.  So I ordered these gloves and the fit is fine (not as snug as the Costco gloves) but be very careful when you are putting them on because they will rip if you tug to hard.  So I probably won't be ordering these when the gloves are back in stock at Costco but they'll do for now.

My hands are small/med so I ordered Medium but they are too snug.

For the price, these are fine. However, note that they tear very easily. Not the best quality, but good for simple use.

Bought the gloves for cleaning purposes. The gloves are thinner than  the ones I'm use to purchasing in the store. The store was out, these arrived in less than 24hrs after purchase. Because of that I would buy again. However, if your looking for a more sturdier glove, these are not it.

Runs smaller in size.

Box for gloves was ripped in two places.  Gloves crammed into box.  Seemed very this and might rip easy.  Would not putchade again.

I am use to the fit of the Costco gloves which have been unavailable for a long time.These are sloppy in fit, but at least you could get them!

They almost wear like a latex or nitrile. Much better than a food service glove. But they smell like mildew or fetid water... Something not good. However, the different brand vinyl gloves we use at work have the same smell. Must be the material.

I have very small hands...these cut off my circulation.

They are a light plastic and not very strong

Used for a varied of uses.  Tendency to stick to everuthing

These gloves are thin but good for doing basic housework or cooking.

These Vinyl disposable gloves are definitely average in quality. The tears almost always happen when I pull the gloves towards my wrist. It occurs constantly...like every 3 pairs ends up tearing. While I understand that it’s difficult to get PPE (personal protective equipment) due to the corona outbreak, it doesn’t help much when these end up with holes in it so easily.

At my work have went to really cheap gloves.. Work in food industry.. Need gloves to fit, and not be too big.. These fit well.. Going to try the large next..but overall will be ordering again..

Durable. Slightly snug but good quality.

Good product.  Good value. Well packaged and shipped on time.  They are not well fitting. They are a cheap disposable product.  Only to be used on simple things.  Not recommended for gardening, mechanical work and other projects as they are very thin and tear easily. Not for medical use. You get what you pay for.  Did arrive well packaged and expediently.

Many of the gloves have an invisible hole as water comes in immediately after I wash dishes wearing the gloves. I wear gloves to protect my hands from the dish soap but these gloves won’t protect my hands as the daily water leaks in.

These gloves are not to be used for cooking or handling anything wet.  They stick to your fingers and defeat the purpose of having gloves on.  You can use them for other things such as protection when pumping gas, painting, etc.  The product did arrive on time.

It is so tight in my hand.It suppose to be a medium it feel like it is a small and I already have a small hand.It tip easy when I try to put the glove on.It feel really tight in my hand.Ig u going to buy this buy a bigger gloves cause they made them feel to tight

The box was completely smashed when it arrived, so they don't pop out neatly. These rip every time I put them on. It's usually just one rip near the wrist, so it's not a huge deal. Not great quality, but I do like them better than latex.

Defective.Inferior batch. Many gloves coming out of the box split and unusable. Waste of money on this supply. Others rip easily when putting on

These are very thin and rip very easily. They will work for simple cleaning if you wear 2 pairs at once.

While I haven't had any rip or tear, they fit tight (medium)and difficult to get on. Maybe order larger size?

The medium glove was too small for my hands.  Will purchase again but get larger size.

They aren't fitting at the wrist.

Although this are very comfortable and they fit right, every other pair rips very easily when putting them on, I purchased M size and even though I have room still they rip very easily I guess you get what you pay for

They were okay once they were on but even though I have small hands when I had to pull them on they would easily tear.

I ordered medium, which is my usual size, but they don’t come up very far up on my wrists. Otherwise, OK.

The fingers are too long for a M size and the tips are not filled and because of this the glove comes off sometimes.

The vinyl is very thin and will break open easily!

If there’s a next time, I’ll order a large (the ones we ordered were medium), my wife can wear them...but, they are too tight for me to get on.

Maybe I received a bad batch but these don’t last long at all!!

Great product.. just to expensive for my crafting use.. i use up to 20 a day..  not to practice for my use.

vinyl makes the hand sweaty  - should not have bought them.

The gloves were cheaply made.

I was shocked to see the gloves tear when I put them on. Even if this is a fluke, with the danger of the coronavirus, I have no confidence these gloves will afford us protection.

They tear with the slightest thing. Definitely wouldn't recommend.

Medium gloves are usually great for me; these feel extra small. They also rip pretty easily, so meh.

Product is ok but no so good. sometimes when you wear the gloves its getting tear in general situations it can be ok but with all the current virus situation outside it will be difficult and trust on these

Tore easy

They tear somewhat easily.

They leak and tear em easily

Would not purchase again

I used it for cleaning kennels and things like that but they tore around the wrist when pulling them on.

Value for money. Easy to rip.

Tears easily. Not a good product.

You get what you pay for with this

These gloves are too small; they about one-third compared with other "Medium" gloves from two other vendors I have bought from.

These gloves are very thin and tear easily. I'm not happy with the quality.

Much smaller than anticipated. Gloves are ok Light duty use. They do the job.

Good for wiping and cleaning but will tear.After short use.

Funny smell and made my hands itch a little. Not sure if Ill use them.

Kept slitting though they were the right size

They rip fairly easy

Came faster than expected, but there not as durable. Need to be careful when putting on, cuz it tears easily. Once on, it will do the job.

Product is just ok.

Perfect size for my hands, quality is okay, but a little over priced.

It is tearing while pulling on hand

Tear easily

Rips easily. Not high quality. If you're in need of wearing disposable gloves they will do for a short while, like cleaning. Don't expect durability.

I only liked it's comfort

Too thick, odd shape

Box came opened.

Rip when putting on

Runs a bit small...bought medium, probably should have gone with the large.  Thickness pretty good.

They are not very sturdy for cleaning

They are a little difficult to get on without tearing.

Gloves are good. Decent quality.

Used for hand coverage when outside.

I have two gloves ripped pulling out of the box .

These gloves will do for now. Very thin, but still good for prepping foods.

They are small and break very easily.

They are too small but that was on me.

Es un producto bueno, le material es bueno, el tamaño es Exacto. Me gusto todo

Very small gloves to be called medium!!!

Cleaning & protection

expensive

Okay

I ordered large gloves. I am a nurse and have been wearing gloves for 40 years. I couldn't get them on my hands. They are not true to size. I would not buy them again.

I use these to resin products and usually wear them about 30 minutes before the thumb and at least one other finger break.?

Medium was a little too big but small was too small . They are fine for my needs tho. I had to return the small ones.

"The media could not be loaded.I was super disappointed by this slime. It has like no stretch to it. Like as soon as I opened it and tried it the slime broke to pieces in my hand. After a few rubs it softens but still has no real stretch to it so of course it's easy to clean. I was disappointed as planned to use them as stocking stuffers for my nephews. I was able to save it however by getting a Mason jar and putting water in it and leaving three if them in the jar over night. In the morning it was much more slime like. It still breaks apart but has a lot more stretch though also a bit sticky but not too much and still easy to clean."

"The media could not be loaded.SEVERAL of the small jars inside the box were totally liquified and not slime at all.  Very disappointing as I had ordered these for my class and now do not have enough to give one to each student :("

"The media could not be loaded.I purchased this to use as party favors for my son's birthday, but after opening the package I discovered half of the slime containers were just liquid. They had the consistency of water and were completely unusable. I'm not sure if this was a bad batch, or something else happened, but I didn't have enough good ones for all party guests and would not recommend to other buyers."

Product was very small and watery.

Theyre for a birthday party coming up, I let my daughter open a couple up to play with since there are extras. The slime wasn’t very plyable and just broke into chunks. It was also watery, like there was water all over it when she opened it. I told her to play with it a bit maybe it just needed to be worked a bit. That did not help either, hoping all of them aren’t a complete loss. Won’t purchase again in the future.

Great slime, live the colors...slime is so small, comes in a very small container.  Marketing is misleading

Waaaaay smaller than I thought they’d be. Not worth the money. I bought this for a carnival fundraiser. Super small for each one. Big enough sized for a toddler that you watch. But too small for our 5 year old. I wouldn’t but this again for $17.

I bought these as birthday party favors.  Luckily I bought invisibile ink pens as well.  THE pens worked and were a hit!Many of the balls were cracked and the "slime" leaking out and dried out.  Don't waste your money OR order early and check them carefully, leaving time for returns if necessary

Product arrived very beat up looking (exterior box was perfectly fine). The box edges were very frayed and a little squished at the corners. Although the box damage wasn't enough to damage the slime balls, the balls looked very used. They looked all scraped up and felt dirty. Balls didn't look all that full and one had a small leak. If I didn't need them for party favors, I would have returned them.

These little containers of slime are all the same color - there is no 'galaxy' to them at all.When they arrived, they were liquified.  The containers are so small, I will have to give multiples as party favors.  : (

I returned this because it was more slime than putty. I expected stretchy putty given the description. It was somewhat wet, though not sticky at all. It just was not what I expected from the description.  If you want slime, this would be great and the colors are great.

6 of the slimes were not even galaxy slime. They were some other slime balls with little toys/pieces in them that fall out.

I was disappointed as this was not like slime at all. Was more like rubber texture. Didn't ooze thoughtfulness like in video. If I had something else as a last minute gift to put in my gift bag. I would return it.

Wayyy smaller than I imagined

The slime looks amazing in the little orbs but when you open it, it’s hard (not like slime) and bounces like a ball but will get debris stuck on it.

Consistency is more like putty, breaks apart, doesn’t stretch. Great colors, just not stretchy.

All the balls were dry. There was no stretching to them. Highly disappointed

All the slime was a dark ugly color.There was no mix of various colors.

Muy pequeña,la verdad no era lo que esperaba

Slime didn't stretch. I wouldn't buy it again.

Not like real slime. It doesn't stretch.

Really really small. My fault for not reading enough.

"The media could not be loaded.I was super disappointed by this slime. It has like no stretch to it. Like as soon as I opened it and tried it the slime broke to pieces in my hand. After a few rubs it softens but still has no real stretch to it so of course it's easy to clean. I was disappointed as planned to use them as stocking stuffers for my nephews. I was able to save it however by getting a Mason jar and putting water in it and leaving three if them in the jar over night. In the morning it was much more slime like. It still breaks apart but has a lot more stretch though also a bit sticky but not too much and still easy to clean."

I work at housecleaning and need to use gloves.  Every time I use these, the glove breaks within short use.  Other brands I've purchased and used last the whole day.  Unfortunately, these do not seem to be of the same quality.

I bought these for my small business when I couldn't get gloves from my usual supplier due to covid. We have now (finally) used up these gloves and thank goodness for that! They were probably the worst disposable gloves I've ever used. They are thin, which isn't bad in itself, but they are also very delicate and rip easily, especially at the wrists when donning them. I'm honestly not sure how it's possible, but even when they don't have visible holes, liquids seep in through the vinyl. They must have very small perforations or actually be liquid permeable, which really defeats the purpose of gloves. We use them to work with staining dyes and it's very obvious when a glove fails. This happened with probably 75% or more of the gloves from this supplier. They might work okay as a barrier from large solids, if that's what you want gloves for, but I wouldn't trust them with anything serious. Everyone is excited to be back to our normal blue nitrile gloves that actually protect your hands.

If you want size and it matters these won't do it, I ordered medium and theses are large at best, quality poor as odors seep through and hands will smell after use. W on't be ordering again unfortunately.

I ordered these gloves once before and they were perfect. The second time I ordered the same size, they were much bigger. Loose fitting while the others were snug.

These gloves are not as durable as the others I used to have. I couldn't find my usual gloves so I got these but they rip and tear so easy. They work fine for delicate and short projects, but the fingers are not strong at all. Neither is the wrist area. Sometimes I break through the wrist pulling them on. I won't buy these kind again.

When I could get them on fully they were good to go! Didn't rip, lasted while in use. BUT..most often they did not fit! Way too small to get over hand, fit was tight on hand couldn't get fingers to come down properly.  OR..they were just screwy, hand would fit but fingers no.  I do NOT recommend these.  I also tried to contact seller but they did not reply.

Cheap, cheap, cheap. I only bought those because Walmar* was out of their inexpensive house brand and I needed gloves for a urgent project.So thin that my hands, fingers and fingernails were stained all blue when I was dying a piece of clothing navy blue.ANd forget using these to do any type of yard work. Tears too easily.

a few things, these gloves run small, they tend to rip without too much pressure or exertion and overall they shrivel when they come into contact with rubbing alcohol above 80% - not impressed

I don't use these at work; I got these at home because I care for a relative who has bladder and bowel issues. I thought I would save a few dollars, but I throw away one if three. They tear when you put them on, and they do not go on easily at all. If you want some cheap gloves, get them a size bigger than you need. I also find powdering my hands helps a lot, but all the science says that powder is not good for patients. (My relative is close to the end, so the powder is not as relevant for her.)Anyway, skip these and buy better gloves.

I had read the reviews and there were good reviews.....hmmmmFor me, these gloves are difficult to put on, and more than once they split as I was putting them on...I would only buy these again, if there was a glove shortage again,( like there was during the Covid-19 panic.)I have bought much better gloves.  Now I know.

Okay, so these gloves smell like mildew, musty odor.  Every single glove on the inside makes my hands have that odor and its hard to get off, I can't use them for hardly anything because I don't trust that some kind of unseen mold spore is going to get on whatever I use it for. So I'm using them with super hot water to rinse my dishes before putting them in the dishwasher. I'm disappointed, the box shows no sign of mildew, mold, water damage or anything. I'll never buy them again

Gloves ripped easily just from thumb movement. I wear a medium and barely have any fingernails and my fingernails started coming through the glove only after minutes of use.  Not heavy duty use at all.

Waste of money.  Tears very easily and too thin.  I put them on and in five minutes there is a huge tear on the back of my hand.  Do not buy this garbage.  Look for something thicker that does not tear so easily.

They are loose compared to other medium sizes. Hard to work with

The gloves run small

Wont recommend it.Product arrived in opened position and also looks likesomebody used them previously as you can see in firstpic something is stuck in glove and couldn't open that glove.

These gloves fit great and they are very comfortable. Unfortunately, each pair I’ve worn, at least one fingertip ripped each time. I guess the price was a little too good to be true.

I work with the public and we ran out of medium gloves. I bought these. The gloves are pretty fragile and you have to pull them on carefully. Also they stick to my hands like nobody's business and they leave a slightly weird coat on my hands when I take them off. Still, it's better than a sharp stick in the eye.

Having a problem with the gloves ripping around the fingers while putting on. The first ones I put on were fine- no problem. Perhaps I need a large size.

They are not durable and tear easily. They get the job done but you have to grab a few for replacements

These gloves rip very easily. Even now that I know this I still rip about half of them while putting them on. I will not buy again.

A decent thickness to the gloves, but QA of the product is HORRID. I've had-to toss several gloves due to holes and ripped seamlines -- that's straight from the box without trying them on, I might add.So far, I've utilized about 15-pair, and have thrown away at least that many because they're unusable. I will not purchase this product, again.

Dont buy these gloves, they don't fit well and they split when you put them on. The gloves are shoved into the box so when you pull or try to pull a glove out a bunch comes out of the box.

Medium in any brand disposable gloves is my size and I can barely get these on. Other than the fit they are durable and a good value.

So for the price I paid I would have hoped for better gloves. I wanted them to use for cleanliness around my home mainly when I use strong chemicals like bleach. The water still goes into the gloves defeating the purpose of the use. There’s really no point in me wearing them to stop contact with chemicals if it still somehow gets in there.

I had to wear 2 so it last a little longe  I use these gloves to work in the  yard, very light garden work not commercials  tasks

tThe box was ripped apart.  Had to take gloves out of box and put in a bin.

Not 100% of these gloves are usable, some are stuck together, some are thin, some break when putting them on. Med size is really closer to a small. I use these in the kitchen for food prep and for light cleaning and I would not purchase these again.

i've ordered before, but this time the boxes were all smashed up inside the soft mailer + also the gloves ripped at the bottom when pulling them on - had to double up. pack them in a box next time please.

The quality was about what was expected. I should have spent $5 more for nitrile. I question the quality control. I know money is an object but I would not buy these again. Dirt was found inside a glove today.

I use gloves while I am working with resin and paint. These gloves did not hold up at all. I have to use 2 or 3 pair for one project. Dont waste your money.

These are the thinnest gloves I’ve ever seen. They ripped on my hand.

The gloves are thinner than the previous vinyl gloves I had and the fit is tighter, making them harder to get on  or off, uncomfortable, and probably less effective as a shield for the virus.

It’s ok but not a good quality

Tight on hands, fingers are too long.

These gloves are very thin and they tear very easily.

Ordered medium, as I have small hands. Struggle to get these on.

I was lucky to find these available online. They were out of size large so I bought a medium thinking too big for me but hopefully my husband could use them too. Sadly I was barely able to get my small hands into them and impossible for my husband. Not durable enough to use for any cleaning.

Quick shipment, but I don't think I can use these gloves for anything since they rip so easily.  Hard to put them even on small hands.  I don't recommend these at all.

Not durable at all. If your hands are not bone dry good luck getting them on without breaking them

No matter how careful I cam, I still tear 1 out of every 10 gloves

These gloves are thin and break easily between the fingers.I wouldn't buy these, find something better.

These suck, are thin and break easily

Don’t buy it, the quality is really bad, it’s broken when I receive it, and the doesn’t work well, it’s a waste of money!!

These are not good gloves for care giving a patient. Maybe ok for cleaning but don't fit well and tear very easily

Leak and some tear as you pull them on. Cheaply made. About half are good.

Unfortunately these are very weak and break while just putting them on a lot of the time.

These gloves tears easily and is thin.  almost everytime when i put on the gloves they tend to tear with ease.  They are also smaller than what you'd expect.

These gloves are not a true size medium there more like a women's petite size medium you might have to size up and get an extra large just for a comfort fit if you want a true medium size.

Ordered these gloves recently mainly for the purpose of bathroom cleaning. These are tearing very easily. Whole purpose of buying these is gone. Not recommended for cleaning.

Every day use

Gloves are ok quality. The smell while wearing them and after removing them is horrible. Don’t think I will wear beyond the first pair. Money wasted ☹️

The constantly split putting them on.  They are not strong at all.

Tear easily

Tight fit. Always tears at wrist when putting on

These gloves are not very durable.  They tear with just putting them on.  Sized smaller than advertosed

Smaller than the size indicated on the boxSmall. Too small..medium are probably small.  Large ate not large. They don't fit

These broke easily. They're nice and thick and I would recommend for any craft that doesn't need lengthy wear.

These gloves rip really easy and some already had holes. Wont be buying again.

They tear when you put them on. No stretch

Thickness is good, but I have used other gloves which are more comfortable and have better quality.

they are stiff and not at all flexible to use on patients! hard to get on and off

They are a tight fit and they rip easily.

These fit much smaller than size states.  Very disappointed.

Disappointed with this product. Gloves ripped immediately while putting on. Not a heavy duty glove.

So stinky! Smells like mold!!!

Fit well but gave me rash.

Se rompen muy facilmente

They are very thin

Run very small

Size is Smaller than stated

Cheap, thin material given the ridiculously high price.

Very thin. The gloves are clear. I will try to wear 2 pairs at a time.

To thin.

Poorly constructed, VERY small. Not true to size advertised.

Very thin and cheep quality.  Rips apart while trying to put them on.

I have small hands, and these "medium" gloves are very difficult to get on.

These gloves tear easily very poor quality

It’s ok, durability is kind of subpar. When I try to put on the gloves, they ripped.

This Gloves are very thin. I had torn up many of them. The quality is poor. I would never buy it again!

Very poor quality!

These gloves are pretty flimsy and thin. Sometimes, gloves rip when I try to put them on. Guess you get what you pay for. Cheap quality and won’t buy again.

Tear very easily!

Tear up easily, don't really fit because of the material

I’m bummed about these gloves. They keep ripping every time I put them on..and they weren’t cheap!

"The media could not be loaded.If I could give negative stars I would.  It’s not slime at all, it’s more of a play-dough consistency. It tears apart instead of stretching like slime. Extremely disappointed with this purchase."

I received slime that was drying out and not stretchy at all. The liquid was leaking out of some of the plastic balls. Would not buy again.

I bought these for my students and I am so disappointed I wasted my money on these. The texture is weird and watery. It doesn't recombine or combine with the others it came with. I seriously regret buying this garbage.

It falls apart in your hands it’s not stretchy at all it’s crumbly and it smells like chemicals, the most horrible slime I have ever purchased for my students. Do not waste your money!

Bought this for kids party bags and they are trash. They are super watery and come apart in to a million little pieces . Had to clean it multiple times off tables and floor.Would not recommend or buy again.

Not stretchy like in the video. The majority does not stretch. You'd have to go through each one to find one that actually resembles slim.

Slime is crumbly and not like what is advertised.

It's like play doh. Wasn't slimy like i expected.

Find a better slime, this does not act like slime. It’s a stiff non-stretch cold puddy. Doesn’t “pour” or stretch like real slime. Very pretty looking? But such a waste—would have returned but I packed them all up for birthday party favors and didn’t know until my son opened one later.

"The media could not be loaded.Got this for my sons party favors and more than half are liquid, not even slime. You open and it just pours out like water.. super disappointed"

What initially was entertaining for my daughter, turned out to be a safety concern. The slime somehow melted into her blanket and ended in her hair. It took a while to clean out. Also the small pieces in the slime resembled candies which can easily be removed from the slime and potentially be mistaken and swallowed. Definitely be cautious. Would not buy again.

I didn't like the slime party favor.  It looked cute and my girls love to play with slime.  but Galaxy Slime, Party Favor for Kids Girls & Boys was watery, a loose puddle they could not play with.

Very rubbery and hard. Cute but not slime material.

The product is tiny! I didn't realize it was so small until it arrived. It also doesn't stretch at all, it break apart, definitely pass on this one.

"The media could not be loaded.So watery!!!  Was a gift for my students and they can’t play with it."

Very disappointed in this product. It did not stretch at all. It did smell pretty good, not like chemicals like the other manufactured slimes. But it did not stretch at all.  I checked all of them and all of them were exactly the same. It was very disappointing because although the product is for children, I have adult autism and I use those slimes as a stemming toy. I do not recommend this product other than maybe children’s birthday Favors although the children would probably not enjoy  what they’re playing with because like I said it does not stretch, it breaks as soon as you try to stretch it.

"The media could not be loaded.I hate when I feel like I have wasted my hard earned money. This is not what one expects when one orders slime. It is just breaking into clumps when you pull as normal. Sometimes it stretches if you are super gentle. Ridiculous!!! Very disappointed as these are expensive favors for my kid's birthday. Consumers deserve products that work as advertised otherwise your product is just deliberately dishonest. Amazon do better!!!The little beads inside are not necessary. Annoying even. The kids just picked them out before playing with the slime."

I purchased this because it specifically said that the slime was not sticky. This is incorrect. It was extremely sticky. My kids couldn’t even play with it because it just got stuck all over their hands.

Half of them were okay, the other half were the consistency of water. Spilled everywhere.

Opened the box to find only 17 slime balls out of the 24 as advertised. Do not recommend! Will be returning.

Most of the slime jars were liquid when they arrived. Now I have to return them when they came defective.

Bought this for goodie bags and am glad I let my son open one to try before I handed them out. The slime doesn’t hold together at all—after he played with it for a few minutes, it had separated into tiny bits and smeared all over the table. It was very hard to clean up. Not fun for my son to play with and not fun for me to get back into the cup. I would strongly recommend against this one.

"The media could not be loaded.No stretch. Pure colored water!!! Waste of money and embarrassed I sent these as a gift. Scam!!!I wish I could give this negative stars"

It's hard to be happy when they arrive like this. When I received the box I didn't even need to open it to know there was a mess inside. The box was soggy wet with slime and falling apart. I can't even return it because it was just a pile of wet goop and the box literally fell apart. The balls are cute looking... Though I did expect them to be slightly larger. It's fairly non-sticky on hands, but DO NOT get it on fabric. The couch is literally ruined where the slime leaked on it. The slime fused to the microfiber and has been impossible to get off. It's mind boggling that they don't protect them better for shipping. What a waste.

You can’t play with it. It tears apart right away. Retuned it right away. It was a disappointment for my kid

3 of the 24 cups were straight water. The other 21 seemed attractive in the packaging. However, when we opened and started playing with the slime, it didn’t stretch and didn’t even form back into one piece together. It fell into chunks in my hand, on my clothes, on my floor. Complete mess. Complete waste of my money and lame Halloween giveaway prize.

The packaging was well done. The balls each had a tight plastic wrap. I let my son open up a few that we didn't need.  We discovered that three of the slime balls we opened simply broke in half when we tried to stretch them. The slime broke in half within a quarter of an inch of stretching it.  If you ever made a similar DIY slime at home or school with your kids, it seems too much activator was added, causing this product to break like a soft gumball; Not stretch.

"The media could not be loaded.Don't waste time nor money most of them are just a liqthat never forms into slime. I will return this product."

"The media could not be loaded.It was watery not slimy !  So disappointed.."

THIS PRODUCT IS NOT AS DESCRIBE. THIS IS NOT AN ANXIETY RELIEF . ONE PACKAGE WAS OPENED AND IT LOOKS VERY AWFUL. ONE CANNOT EVEN HOLD IT TOGETHER, THIS IS NOT A SLIME. THIS CAN NEVER BE COMPARED TO SLIME AT ALL. POOR QUALITY AND FTS A FULL OF JUNK. I WASTED MY MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT FOR NOTHING. I WILL NEVER BUY THIS AGAIN, AND I DO NOT  RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYBODY, AM VERY DISAPPOINTED. BAD PRODUCT. THE WORSE PRODUCT EVER!! ZERO RATING

This item was nothing but pure water. I bought these for my son's birthday. I gave them to the quests who came and when they opened them it was pure water and not slimy at all. I would not waste money on these again

My 6yo old says, “it looks cool in the jar, but not fun to play with.” It breaks apart and leaves residue. I don’t recommend this product.

"The media could not be loaded.Watery not slime"

I bought this product to add to the birthday goody bags. My daughter opened one for herself and it’s horrible. It breaks. I would return them but party is next day. I would love my money or at least half of my money back.

I guess I'm one of the people who got a bad batch!  Slime literally crumbled and wasn't even close to regular slime!  My grandchildren didn't enjoy it, because it didn't go back to a solid slime!  Am sending back!

Do not buy! I bought these for my child’s class treasure box contribution. I opened to make sure they were suitable and every single ball (individually wrapped) would just break open. No slime, just break. It was laughable. And just a FYI if (not even half) the balls had gems in them the gems were really really scary teeny tiny and weird. Just odd.

Hate leaving bad reviews but, I bought this for my son as a Christmas gift because he loves Galaxy slimes. I wanted to see how well they stretched before wrapping them up. It seems our batch has way too much borax or something in it, they don't stretch at all, instead they break apart. With him having ADHD slimes help him relax but this just isn't going to do.

These galaxy slime balls look nothing like the photo. The box says 24 colors. All but 5 are just a murky purple blob. The other 5 have rubber ducks and watermelons in them. That won’t work well with our alien themed gift bags for my son to hand out at school.

It wasn't like regular slime. It kept its form as a ball and when you would try to play with it,  it would just tear.

I have never written a review before.  I am so disappointed in this product, I just had to warn everyone not to waste their money.  The “slime” does not stretch at all.  It just breaks off.  I was going to put these in gift bags for my son’s birthday party, but they are going in the trash.  Do not buy.

Initially we were so excited to find these small slime balls to use as some advent calendar fillers. Only to find out the slime inside seems old. As soon as we pulled the slime out of the plastic balls the ‘ripped’ apart. Although the kids were disappointed we did figure out you could microwave it for a couple seconds. Wouldn’t purchase these again.

I have tried everything on google to help me figure out how to get rid of this slime from my new $5,000 couches & the stains are not coming off! :(

I bought these for my students to use when they finish work early or earn a brain break. They were devastated when six of them went gooey— too wet and sticky to use, one by one. They were stored high on a shelf and were not exposed to temperature changes or water. They created a huge mess. It was awful.

They are squishy but there's zero stretch to the slime. Very disappointed

Tiny quarter sized cups. Sent them back as fast as they came. I thought it would be something fun for the kids to "sell" at our yardsale, but these were ridiculous.

I bought this product for a class party of 20 kids. It came the day before with only 19 slimes. Do not purchase.

They didn’t come as slime- more like rubber balls- they broke apart straight out of the container. The ones that have little trinkets inside, they fly all over the floor. Company said they’d replace- what’s the point, it was for Christmas?

I was excited that the slime came so quickly.  I purchased these to go into my kids Halloween treat bags, but because the slime has an expiration date of 06/21/2020, I am afraid to give these to the children.  I'm disappointed 😞

I returned this product very small! Not great for party favors if they were bigger would have been better! Seems like a price gouge for the size

Cheap and smells horrible. Would not buy for kiddos.

Barely squeeze and the “slime” falls apart like.  Very brittle.  Go to Target and buy their $1 slimes.

In the video it shows the slime stretched and pulled and actually slime I get it for my daughter and it's just thick and not one drop of sliming went on it just literally broke apart



Horrible. All solid. No slime. Sadly, did not realize this until gift bags had been passed out at the birthday party. What a waste.

It was to small, it’s to watery and it keep falling apart didnt stick together

These break down over time and become sticky and are not useable. Also it has the WORST chemical smell. Ended up throwing these away. Do not recommend.

There are tiny and cheaply made. The slime was not galaxy like at all. It was one brown color and they all had oozed out from the lids.

False Advertising- this is not stretchy or slimy.  It crumbles- what’s a kid supposed to do with that?

This is NOT the kind of slime your kids want! The slime is just like jello and once you smash it it breaks into pieces and won’t stick back together.

Bought for a party but didn’t use. Did not like.

Unfortunately for us these were more like pull apart plastic balls rather than the slime consistency we were expecting.

Color dulled within a few minutes of play. Looks brown now.

Slime does not stretch, it crumbles into small pieces. If it gets on fabric, that fabric is ruined. Gives off sickening odor. Totally worthless. Don’t waste your money!

"The media could not be loaded.Horrible don’t recommend"

It's not slime, not at all.  It crumbles.

This product is not slime. When my child tried to knead it and pull it it ripped into pieces.I wasted my money on this junk.

Every individual slime was hardened and unable to be played with

This slime is not stretchy. It breaks apart. I would not recommend this product.

Este slime es terriblemente malo no tiene elasticidad y huele a jabon de lavar platos, mala inversion siento que perdi el dinero.

Nice colors,but this stuff is very stiff and not slime at all.

Product expired almost a year ago!

Just opened box right now and one of the tops was off and slime spilled all inside box

NOT SLIME.  HARD AND NOT STRETCHY.  WASTE OF MONEY!

Very watery

I would not recommend purchasing this product. It’s very messy to play with and just kept on sticking on kids’ hands.

Super small tubs. Maybe worth $5

Wtf is this?! Don’t recommend.

Opened 1 got moldy in 3 days in containers it came in.

Horrible. Way smaller then the picture stated

Half were dried out. Don't buy this!

Very disappointed because it’s not slime.

Not very good

It was extremely watery to the point it actually left water marks on every surface it sat on. It did not stretch much at all and broke apart very easily. The kids did not like it. I do not recommend this product.

Packaging is cute the with balls, but the kids could not play with it, not stretchy, broke into pieces. Had to throw away. Not worth the money. Disappointed.

This slime acts more like jelly or something. It crumbles into tiny pieces and doesn’t stretch *AT ALL*. I don’t know if we got a bad batch or what, but none of the containers are usable so far. When we dump a container into our hand, it still keeps the basic shape of the container. So bummed because these were supposed to be prizes for school!

The slime I received is either old or just poorly manufactured. It has no stretch to it and breaks apart when pulled. I bought these as prizes for the kids in my class and they immediately brought to my attention that the slime was poor quality and did not stretch as it should. They were very disappointed. Don’t waste your money on this seller’s product, try your luck elsewhere.

This is my 4 year old hand lol small size

Soooooo tiny that it’s absolutely pointless and worthless. Not to mention it’s not the right consistency so it just breaks apart into little tiny crumbles of slime and isn’t even able to be played with. HUGE waste of money and I’m super disappointed. They were bought as stocking stuffers for a preschool classroom because I thought they’d be nice but they’re such a waste of money.

"The media could not be loaded.If I could give negative stars I would.  It’s not slime at all, it’s more of a play-dough consistency. It tears apart instead of stretching like slime. Extremely disappointed with this purchase."

I received slime that was drying out and not stretchy at all. The liquid was leaking out of some of the plastic balls. Would not buy again.

I bought these for my students and I am so disappointed I wasted my money on these. The texture is weird and watery. It doesn't recombine or combine with the others it came with. I seriously regret buying this garbage.

It falls apart in your hands it’s not stretchy at all it’s crumbly and it smells like chemicals, the most horrible slime I have ever purchased for my students. Do not waste your money!

Bought this for kids party bags and they are trash. They are super watery and come apart in to a million little pieces . Had to clean it multiple times off tables and floor.Would not recommend or buy again.

Not stretchy like in the video. The majority does not stretch. You'd have to go through each one to find one that actually resembles slim.

Slime is crumbly and not like what is advertised.

It's like play doh. Wasn't slimy like i expected.

Find a better slime, this does not act like slime. It’s a stiff non-stretch cold puddy. Doesn’t “pour” or stretch like real slime. Very pretty looking? But such a waste—would have returned but I packed them all up for birthday party favors and didn’t know until my son opened one later.

"The media could not be loaded.Got this for my sons party favors and more than half are liquid, not even slime. You open and it just pours out like water.. super disappointed"

What initially was entertaining for my daughter, turned out to be a safety concern. The slime somehow melted into her blanket and ended in her hair. It took a while to clean out. Also the small pieces in the slime resembled candies which can easily be removed from the slime and potentially be mistaken and swallowed. Definitely be cautious. Would not buy again.

I didn't like the slime party favor.  It looked cute and my girls love to play with slime.  but Galaxy Slime, Party Favor for Kids Girls & Boys was watery, a loose puddle they could not play with.

Very rubbery and hard. Cute but not slime material.

The product is tiny! I didn't realize it was so small until it arrived. It also doesn't stretch at all, it break apart, definitely pass on this one.

"The media could not be loaded.So watery!!!  Was a gift for my students and they can’t play with it."

Very disappointed in this product. It did not stretch at all. It did smell pretty good, not like chemicals like the other manufactured slimes. But it did not stretch at all.  I checked all of them and all of them were exactly the same. It was very disappointing because although the product is for children, I have adult autism and I use those slimes as a stemming toy. I do not recommend this product other than maybe children’s birthday Favors although the children would probably not enjoy  what they’re playing with because like I said it does not stretch, it breaks as soon as you try to stretch it.

"The media could not be loaded.I hate when I feel like I have wasted my hard earned money. This is not what one expects when one orders slime. It is just breaking into clumps when you pull as normal. Sometimes it stretches if you are super gentle. Ridiculous!!! Very disappointed as these are expensive favors for my kid's birthday. Consumers deserve products that work as advertised otherwise your product is just deliberately dishonest. Amazon do better!!!The little beads inside are not necessary. Annoying even. The kids just picked them out before playing with the slime."

I purchased this because it specifically said that the slime was not sticky. This is incorrect. It was extremely sticky. My kids couldn’t even play with it because it just got stuck all over their hands.

Half of them were okay, the other half were the consistency of water. Spilled everywhere.

Opened the box to find only 17 slime balls out of the 24 as advertised. Do not recommend! Will be returning.

Most of the slime jars were liquid when they arrived. Now I have to return them when they came defective.

Bought this for goodie bags and am glad I let my son open one to try before I handed them out. The slime doesn’t hold together at all—after he played with it for a few minutes, it had separated into tiny bits and smeared all over the table. It was very hard to clean up. Not fun for my son to play with and not fun for me to get back into the cup. I would strongly recommend against this one.

"The media could not be loaded.No stretch. Pure colored water!!! Waste of money and embarrassed I sent these as a gift. Scam!!!I wish I could give this negative stars"

It's hard to be happy when they arrive like this. When I received the box I didn't even need to open it to know there was a mess inside. The box was soggy wet with slime and falling apart. I can't even return it because it was just a pile of wet goop and the box literally fell apart. The balls are cute looking... Though I did expect them to be slightly larger. It's fairly non-sticky on hands, but DO NOT get it on fabric. The couch is literally ruined where the slime leaked on it. The slime fused to the microfiber and has been impossible to get off. It's mind boggling that they don't protect them better for shipping. What a waste.

You can’t play with it. It tears apart right away. Retuned it right away. It was a disappointment for my kid

3 of the 24 cups were straight water. The other 21 seemed attractive in the packaging. However, when we opened and started playing with the slime, it didn’t stretch and didn’t even form back into one piece together. It fell into chunks in my hand, on my clothes, on my floor. Complete mess. Complete waste of my money and lame Halloween giveaway prize.

The packaging was well done. The balls each had a tight plastic wrap. I let my son open up a few that we didn't need.  We discovered that three of the slime balls we opened simply broke in half when we tried to stretch them. The slime broke in half within a quarter of an inch of stretching it.  If you ever made a similar DIY slime at home or school with your kids, it seems too much activator was added, causing this product to break like a soft gumball; Not stretch.

"The media could not be loaded.Don't waste time nor money most of them are just a liqthat never forms into slime. I will return this product."

"The media could not be loaded.It was watery not slimy !  So disappointed.."

THIS PRODUCT IS NOT AS DESCRIBE. THIS IS NOT AN ANXIETY RELIEF . ONE PACKAGE WAS OPENED AND IT LOOKS VERY AWFUL. ONE CANNOT EVEN HOLD IT TOGETHER, THIS IS NOT A SLIME. THIS CAN NEVER BE COMPARED TO SLIME AT ALL. POOR QUALITY AND FTS A FULL OF JUNK. I WASTED MY MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT FOR NOTHING. I WILL NEVER BUY THIS AGAIN, AND I DO NOT  RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYBODY, AM VERY DISAPPOINTED. BAD PRODUCT. THE WORSE PRODUCT EVER!! ZERO RATING

This item was nothing but pure water. I bought these for my son's birthday. I gave them to the quests who came and when they opened them it was pure water and not slimy at all. I would not waste money on these again

My 6yo old says, “it looks cool in the jar, but not fun to play with.” It breaks apart and leaves residue. I don’t recommend this product.

"The media could not be loaded.Watery not slime"

I bought this product to add to the birthday goody bags. My daughter opened one for herself and it’s horrible. It breaks. I would return them but party is next day. I would love my money or at least half of my money back.

I guess I'm one of the people who got a bad batch!  Slime literally crumbled and wasn't even close to regular slime!  My grandchildren didn't enjoy it, because it didn't go back to a solid slime!  Am sending back!

Do not buy! I bought these for my child’s class treasure box contribution. I opened to make sure they were suitable and every single ball (individually wrapped) would just break open. No slime, just break. It was laughable. And just a FYI if (not even half) the balls had gems in them the gems were really really scary teeny tiny and weird. Just odd.

Hate leaving bad reviews but, I bought this for my son as a Christmas gift because he loves Galaxy slimes. I wanted to see how well they stretched before wrapping them up. It seems our batch has way too much borax or something in it, they don't stretch at all, instead they break apart. With him having ADHD slimes help him relax but this just isn't going to do.

These galaxy slime balls look nothing like the photo. The box says 24 colors. All but 5 are just a murky purple blob. The other 5 have rubber ducks and watermelons in them. That won’t work well with our alien themed gift bags for my son to hand out at school.

It wasn't like regular slime. It kept its form as a ball and when you would try to play with it,  it would just tear.

I have never written a review before.  I am so disappointed in this product, I just had to warn everyone not to waste their money.  The “slime” does not stretch at all.  It just breaks off.  I was going to put these in gift bags for my son’s birthday party, but they are going in the trash.  Do not buy.

Initially we were so excited to find these small slime balls to use as some advent calendar fillers. Only to find out the slime inside seems old. As soon as we pulled the slime out of the plastic balls the ‘ripped’ apart. Although the kids were disappointed we did figure out you could microwave it for a couple seconds. Wouldn’t purchase these again.

I have tried everything on google to help me figure out how to get rid of this slime from my new $5,000 couches & the stains are not coming off! :(

I bought these for my students to use when they finish work early or earn a brain break. They were devastated when six of them went gooey— too wet and sticky to use, one by one. They were stored high on a shelf and were not exposed to temperature changes or water. They created a huge mess. It was awful.

They are squishy but there's zero stretch to the slime. Very disappointed

Tiny quarter sized cups. Sent them back as fast as they came. I thought it would be something fun for the kids to "sell" at our yardsale, but these were ridiculous.

I bought this product for a class party of 20 kids. It came the day before with only 19 slimes. Do not purchase.

They didn’t come as slime- more like rubber balls- they broke apart straight out of the container. The ones that have little trinkets inside, they fly all over the floor. Company said they’d replace- what’s the point, it was for Christmas?

I was excited that the slime came so quickly.  I purchased these to go into my kids Halloween treat bags, but because the slime has an expiration date of 06/21/2020, I am afraid to give these to the children.  I'm disappointed 😞

I returned this product very small! Not great for party favors if they were bigger would have been better! Seems like a price gouge for the size

Cheap and smells horrible. Would not buy for kiddos.

Barely squeeze and the “slime” falls apart like.  Very brittle.  Go to Target and buy their $1 slimes.

In the video it shows the slime stretched and pulled and actually slime I get it for my daughter and it's just thick and not one drop of sliming went on it just literally broke apart



Horrible. All solid. No slime. Sadly, did not realize this until gift bags had been passed out at the birthday party. What a waste.

It was to small, it’s to watery and it keep falling apart didnt stick together

These break down over time and become sticky and are not useable. Also it has the WORST chemical smell. Ended up throwing these away. Do not recommend.

There are tiny and cheaply made. The slime was not galaxy like at all. It was one brown color and they all had oozed out from the lids.

False Advertising- this is not stretchy or slimy.  It crumbles- what’s a kid supposed to do with that?

This is NOT the kind of slime your kids want! The slime is just like jello and once you smash it it breaks into pieces and won’t stick back together.

Bought for a party but didn’t use. Did not like.

Unfortunately for us these were more like pull apart plastic balls rather than the slime consistency we were expecting.

Color dulled within a few minutes of play. Looks brown now.

Slime does not stretch, it crumbles into small pieces. If it gets on fabric, that fabric is ruined. Gives off sickening odor. Totally worthless. Don’t waste your money!

"The media could not be loaded.Horrible don’t recommend"

It's not slime, not at all.  It crumbles.

This product is not slime. When my child tried to knead it and pull it it ripped into pieces.I wasted my money on this junk.

Every individual slime was hardened and unable to be played with

This slime is not stretchy. It breaks apart. I would not recommend this product.

Este slime es terriblemente malo no tiene elasticidad y huele a jabon de lavar platos, mala inversion siento que perdi el dinero.

Nice colors,but this stuff is very stiff and not slime at all.

Product expired almost a year ago!

Just opened box right now and one of the tops was off and slime spilled all inside box

NOT SLIME.  HARD AND NOT STRETCHY.  WASTE OF MONEY!

Very watery

I would not recommend purchasing this product. It’s very messy to play with and just kept on sticking on kids’ hands.

Super small tubs. Maybe worth $5

Wtf is this?! Don’t recommend.

Opened 1 got moldy in 3 days in containers it came in.

Horrible. Way smaller then the picture stated

Half were dried out. Don't buy this!

I bought these again by accident. The gloves tear as soon as you put them on. Poor poor durability and hands get wet easily. DO NOT BUY

These are the gloves I usually ordered in a medium. However, I just opened up box, 7 days after my return window. These mediums are so very small & tight, I cannot use them. Very disappointed.

The box was labeled MEDIUM, and I have small hands and always order medium sizes for comfort. But I could not put them on my hands.They are more like child-size.Maybe I should have ordered LARGE!I should return them, but I have opened the box.

This is really confusing. The first few pairs of these gloves were great; however, after 10 or so pairs, the next 10 or so pairs finger tips looked as though they went through a paper shredder. This is an ongoing issue through the entire box, not all but intermittently throughout the nox somehow. Very confused and would not recommend.

They run small and rip easily, not worth your money.

These gloves are garbage. They rip shortly after putting on, and then the backup pair rips as well. Impossible to get the job done with these on. Not to mention, VERY unsafe and unadvisable for those doing work with dangerous chemicals or in medical environments. Will never waste $ on again.

The reasoning for your glove purchase doesn't really matter in the long run because THESE ARE NOT THE ONES. The first pair I pulled out and put on ripped immediately on both palms. These are made out of tissue paper or something similar. Don't waste your ten bucks. I am a nurse and am quite familiar with gloves and how to put them on. And I know that you should be able to wear them for more than 20 seconds before they rip. They were not too small or too large or put on backwards.....just don't bother.

I was looking for gloves to protect my hands while handling or touch surfaces that could be sites of transmitting infectious diseases. The gloves were way too tight for the medium size that I have used by other vendors. The material in the product is cheaply made and tore while attempting to put on. Would never buy these again. I threw the whole box again.

Gosh...the quality is bad. Almost every single glove whenever I use, it doesn't keep from water. BAD

I went through about 5 gloves today in a one hour time frame before finally Justina going to the store and buying a new pack of gloves. I was wearing these while using a cloth to stain some wood, not what I would call vigorous activity and the finger kept ripping, so my fingers are now stained red oak. I don’t usually write reviews but these are probably the worst gloves I’ve ever used.

I'm disappointed, because this was a reorder for gloves I'd purchased that really worked. I don't think same seller, but SAME BRAND of gloves. Anyway, these are bad quality. Period. A few actually tore taking them out of the box. Unreliable gloves if you need something to protect you from something you don't want to touch! I did not contact the seller re a refund. I'd already opened both boxes. It was my error buying them. I'll buy the right gloves (the blue ones) next time.  In the mean time, I'm double gloving.

This gloves are terrible! Some the inside of the gloves had hard black ick on them. The pic is only 3 of the gloves that I photographed  but there was more. This was my second order. The first order had it as well but I thought maybe it was a bad batch so I ordered some again and the also had it. Also would RIP will I was putting them on. Will not by again!

What is wrong with people!! This is a total rip off my mom is 97 years young God bless her I’m her care giver and this Gloves is ineffective they are all rotten and rip every time I used it Covid-19 pandemic I wasn’t able to get my regular at Samms  this is a total rip off I hope Trump do something about these tippled price Grough prices.. please we should be helping each other’s out in these trying times . How many daughter n laws out there taking cake of there mother n law ?Company like these makes Amazon looks bad .

The quality control on these gloves is terrible. I bought multiple boxes for work and ended up having to throw the first one we opened away because almost every glove we pulled out was dirty - black specks and gunk in the rolled up bit at the bottom as well as in the finger tips of each glove. Unacceptable when the entire reason we bought these gloves in the first place was because we needed to keep things sanitary.

Horrible product. Dont ever buy this and waste your money. Firstly the size does not fit. I used to buy medium from other brands thats fits well on my fingers. This one it too tight and rips off very easily. Poor quality. Too sticky to wear, even my kids can't use it either. Not sure how this got 4.5 stars. Must be a scam. Avoid this product.

These gloves are packed so tight in the box and packed in "bunches" so you have to pull out a handful and pull one out of the bunch.  After that I found that many fell apart as I put them on - normally the "wrist" split from the glove  while trying to pull it on.  They did fit well if you got one on.My husband liked them despite this and that is why I have ordered twice.  I would not order this product for me.

They feel overly starched? Idk if that is the best way to explain it but they're stiff. Almost half that I pull out of the box are torn or cut. That's mad annoying but I guess it is what it is

So far, one out of every two gloves have ripped at the cuff while pulling them on. They're not too tight, they go on easily, but as you pull on the cuff to set the gloves on your hands they rip. I will not buy another box of these. Poorly made.

You have to really squeeze your hands into these and take the risk of them ripping. I'm not satisfied at all with these gloves. They should be the size that they say on the box.

I bought size medium which should be plenty big for my small hands but ran on the smaller side. They also did not hold up while I was doing my paint pouring this my hands were stained. I would not recommend this product.

I have small hands so bought the medium. The gloves are so small that I can't even get them on without them tearing. Add the terrible texture ... absolute garbage... don't know how this product can be rated so highly

Sadly i thought after reading the reviews that if i was careful, i could get these on without a problem, big mistake, they are absolutely useless they tear like wet paper the moment you try to put them on.The only reason I'm not sending them back is i don't want too many returns, save your money pay a bit more for something you can use

La más baja calidad que vas a encontrar en unos guantes, vienen rotos y cuando usas los que quedan sin romper se te rompen en las manos casi de inmediato. Muy desencantada!

Difficult to get on without puncturing the thin vinyl material. Mine dissolved when I was using a standard cleaning product.

Tore constantly and were a poor fit. I don't have large hands by any means but these were too tight, too small and were a total pain to get on. I'll go back to buying the more expensive ones now

I ordered these gloves to put on my hand after I apply lotion to help soften them. I don’t have long nails. I’m not working in them but just got out of the hospital after injuring my back. Point being. I lay around wearing these gloves doing next to nothing and they just rip and tear of my hands like I’ve been scrubbing stone. I am seldom disappointed with anything I order on Amazon but this is shameful.

Every pair we have put on has torn incredibly easy with very minor stress involved. If you care about protecting yourself, these are not the glove. If you only care about passing some regulation about wearing gloves, I guess these will do. But they are not safe as far as protecting yourself.

These gloves are terrible. They are not durable at all. Every time you put them on the cuff tears. The fingers get holes in them within a few minutes of wear doing light duty tasks. I was wearing these to sort and hand out food at a food pantry recently and had to change them every few minutes because they kept getting holes in the fingers.

While doing lite work, The gloves tear easily

These gloves are horrible! Don't waste your money. I worked in food service for close to 45 years and I've never tried to use a worse glove. Gloves would rip and tear before I even got to the food prep work.

Not recommended for everyday use. Tears very easy, not durable. Also needs more elasticity.

The gloves were stuck together in a big clump and it was hard to pull them apart.Putting them on is a struggle and if you tug them even slightly - they rip.

I am disappointed in this product. A waste of money. They tear easily & most are unusable. I bought for my mother in law to use in caring for her husband going through chemo. Regret buying them!

This product is nothing more than a folded up we they give you at restaurants and such. Thinnest junk I ever had.0You can maybe dust with them or something. Personally I got out the truck and booted that box put in the corn.Yup, cornfield 4 feet from my garage

Probably the worst gloves I have ever purchased. The feel like they have spent the past 10 years on a shelf

I’ve bought these gloves several times. This time, about 1/3 of the way through the box, almost every other glove was torn!  Not worth going through the trouble to return but I won’t purchase again. Last time my fingers went thru several of them. I’m done. No more!

Each of them was torn. Very bad quality. Even I have relatively small hands, every time we use it, it is torn immediately.  I don't recommend it at all. Waste of money.

These are very inferior and tears on the slightest touch. It's a pity. Now it's too late to return it. What a waste of money. I'll never buy this again.

I assumed all was well when I opened the box but pulling out several gloves, there was a dead bug, flattened and preserved in the

This was not what I order , I saw blue gloves these are white which also look like gloves for food no no wanted medical gloves these are not it .

It doesn’t deserve a star, they are described as durable but they rip easily and not true to its size I ordered medium just to make sure they wouldn’t be tight but they are the M is more like an S!!!

The gloves rip real easy.  Single use….No it should be labeled no use.

Difficult to get on and work with. No give or comfort when on.

"The media could not be loaded.Box arrived completely sealed but when I opened the flap I noticed that the gloves had dirt/mud inside of them! Quite ironic as they are supposed to be used for sanitary purposes. Disappointing, this is a rip off."

Did not like and found them to be Useless.  You pull at one glove and get 15-20 out of box.  Useless tears easily

These are horrible and for the price I expected something of quality. They rip when trying to put on and are a horribly fit which makes them difficult to put on. I do not recommend. I’ve purchased generic gloves of the same material from the pharmacy and they have better durability and are overall a better deal. Do not buy these!

The box was torn and 70% of the gloves inside were filthy which is a big no-no when you buy gloves for protection. Won’t buy again.

The durability isn’t very good, therefore I use or tear more of the gloves necktie he the value out of them.

These are junk.  They rip when you put them on.  The mediums are more like small (ordinary medium latex gloves fit fine).  Vinyl gloves aren't skin tight light latex, so they're not good for fine work like cooking, cleaning, etc.  These may be useful for things like hair coloring where precision isn't an issue.  But look elsewhere.

More than half of these gloves are defective and unusable.  Many are ripped up the palm part of the glove, leaving it useless to pull on.  Put one on last night that an entire finger was missing! I know these weren't top of the line gloves, but the amount of defects is way over the top.  Less than 50% of the gloves are usable.

These gloves are waste, they rip at the finger tip very easy, they not durable and they feel so cheap and thin.

You get what you pay for.  Very thin material.  Rips half the time when I put them on.  Will not purchase again.

Don’t waste your money on these poor quality gloves. First of all the shipping took forever. Once I got them as soon as I put one on it ripped and I thought maybe my hand is too big. I asked my mom who has a small hand to try them on and they ripped as well. They’re so cheap I regret buying them

Don't waste your money.  They are to thin and rip every time you put them on. They even rip as you are taking them out of the box.  What a rip off.

I don't know what happened but this batch has dirty gloves. Not sturdy. Some look used. For the price charged this should never happen. Clearly some one fell down on the job. The first gloves I ordered were very nice and I wrote a nice review. I would like a refund for these.

i order gloves regularly for gardening. tried these. mistake..the medium is actually a small..the gloves are very thin and rip easily.. should have stuck to what i had ordered before.

These gloves are too thin, they tearwhen you open the entrance partto put your hand in, and if youget the glove on, it rips right atincovenient time!!!!  NOT worth ttime and money to send back!  Ionly rated one star because a 0wasn't available

very cheap material feels more like extra small, not happy with them

These break very easily, particularly around the wrist when putting them on. About a third of the gloves in the package seem to be randomly powdered inside, despite being labeled powder-free. And even that’s not done well - - it’s like, a powdered finger or two, not the full glove. Very weird. I don’t trust these at all.

It is to slippery when it gets wet. Bad description. It is too small for my hand.

I bought these due to Covid and for doing dishes etc. They just fall apart when trying to put on. A mild breeze would tear these things to shreds

used the gloves as one-time item.. Do not know the durability.

These gloves break too easily. Not worth a penny IMO. I’m not sure what to do with them - can’t use them.

I know these aren’t technically sterile, I just want them for meat prep.  But it’s just gross when you can tell the dirty box fell apart and someone shoved the gloves back in and then re-sold it.

These are cheaper, thin, plastic (?) gloves.  One size fits all not the size I ordered.  These are the kind of gloves food servers used.  I used to buy these at one of the dollar stores.  Overpriced and not vinyl!  I usually get these for about $2-$3.

these gloves have no elasticity, they are like a stiff plastic. rip easily when getting them on my hand. DO NOT conform to your hand, I got Medium and they are to small. I have bought better gloves. will not Purchase again

Box of gloves soaking wet

A waste of money, rips as you put them on.

These things break every time I try to put them on. They have almost no stretch. These are not the gloves you're looking for

These gloves are so thin that they're difficult to put on. Extremely poor quality compared to any glove I've ever purchased. Ended up throwing the entire box in the trash. Do not recommend for any use.

Water has leaked through these gloves on multiple occasions… I won’t be buying this brand anymore.

These gloves are thin and tear way too easily. I go through twice as many of them for the same job from my previous brand.

Gloves have a definite unpleasant bad odor. Also quality not good. Too late to return so I’m stuck with them. Would definitely not purchase again

These gloves are awful! Rip super easily, run small and hard to get on. Basically they’re trash!

Do not fit.  I have small hands and use medium gloves.  They don't fit my hands. I use NitriDerm medium  which fit fine.

way to small don't believe they are a medium

They are cheap. I got a medium. I am 5'3", not a big guy. Not big hands at all. I barely get my hand in them and they break half the time jus trying to get them on. If you're desperate, get them. Otherwise find something else.

These gloves are not stretchy and they rip easily.

I have pretty small hands and have never needed anything bigger than a medium in gloves.  But these things are so oddly shaped, so narrow, that I can't get them on more than about halfway.  When I tried to tug one on, it tore.

These gloves are stiff and uncomfortable and not what I like.

Bad quality and dirty out of the box.

I used these gloves to rub Mentholatum on my husband’s feet twice now and both times my hands smelled like menthol afterwards. How is the vapor able to penetrate these gloves??

The box was way too small to pack this number of gloves into; very difficult to remove. When I could remove them, many of them were partly fused, causing the gloves to rip, and be unusable. Very disappointed.

Will never buy again gloves tear as I took them out the box.

Practically every glove I used had a hole in them. Thank God I was using for home use and not patient care.

These gloves are horrible. Very thin. They are also really loose around the wrist so liquid gets in them really easy and gets your hand wet anyway. Do not recommend

Garbage! The vinyl sp!its half the time, the product is far too thin to use more than once and they stretch as far as a ninety year old cat.Do not waste your money. I did

They rip very easily

Cleaning

Gloves were ripping as I put them on!  Don't waste your money!

Not satisfied with this product plastic of gloves very thin and when trying to put them on they ripped apart.

I thought they were blue, i hate clear gloves and the top of them are too big, water gets in them easily

They simply break apart when putting them on.  Not flexible, very hard to get on your fingers.  Just an inferior product, will be paying more for a competitor for something that actually works.

Gloves break easily forming holes near finger tips while washing dishes or wet cleaning. It is painful with water going into gloves. Don't waste your money on this product.

Poor quality. Leaks every time I use it.

These gloves are garbage and tear very easy so this purchase was a total loss≥

I order a medium because I wear medium in latex gloves. These gloves were so tiny that my 7 year could barely fit them, it felt like it was cutting of my blood circulation. Way Too Small not a Medium

Gloves tear way to easily.

the box was smashed was not happy/

These vinyl gloves are cheaper than others and it shows. They tear easily and thus are not usable. Very disappointed.

Very thin, every I try to put on a pair, they just pull apart. Very cheap, very disappointed

When putting gloves on the rip when you do .

Rip when you put them on.  Waste of money

These gloves are flemsy; product description is blue these gloves are clear.

The worst gloves I have seen. They start tearing away while wearing itself. Have to use 4 sets of gloves for few hours of work.Definitely not recommended for 'any' purpose. Junk!

They tear easily.  Not reliable protection

These gloves tear very easily. We even doubled up and put on two for each hand and they still tore.

The box arrived completely sealed & when I opened it several gloves had burnt marks on them as well as ripped in several fingers, very disappointed & the seller still has not responded!

Its very thin.. and tearing when I use it for washing.. not recommended..

These gloves are so thin they tear when you are just putting them on. I guess you get what you pay for

They are not durable at all RIP very easily cheaply made

Was not in refrigerator or ice and no one even came to the door. So now we have to throw it out it has been out for some time ham that is

Cheap and difficult to put on

Gloves hard to put on very sticky.

Just awful! Literally every single one of these things ripped on me and when I tried to put them on they were extremely uncomfortable even before that. Do not buy! Very cheaply made!

These gloves are the worst I have purchased! They tear when u put them on because they are so flimsy. Have never seen vinyl gloves so fragile-just weird!

Smell of chemicals (plasticizers?) and yet say safe for food. And as others have said - they rip easily. I consistently rip the cuff just when putting them off. Bleh.

Too thin

A lot of the gloves in the box were defective some had wholes in them some would easily tear while placing them on my handsit was like they were dry rot.

Very disappointed with this glove, they rip when putting them on. Very poor material, my advice do not buy this glove, you'll be wasting your money.  POOR QUALITY!!!

The box was raggedy couldn't even keep the gloves in it because it was so torn up

Beware, these gloves are not heavy duty as Advertised

The box was cut open on both ends when I got it. They are contaminated!

Fingertips tear out very quickly when cleaning.

These tear avout 50% on the time when I put them on.  They fit great once I get them on.  One star.

Very cheaply made and tore when my kids went to put them on.

This product bad quality. They rip putting them on. Over priced...used general cooking, dishes & cleaning. BAD PRODUCT

These are so thin and rip super easy.  Would not buy again.

Cheap- they rip very easily.

I had high hopes but disappointed. Very stiff and tear immediately — an inferior product. Would not purchase again myself and would not recommend for others to purchase.

Terrible gloves-DO NOT BUY.  These gloves are a strange material, rip easily and are very difficult to put on your hands.

Med. very small can not get on (I always have worn Med exam gloves, the tear very easley,

When you pull them on they tear at the cuff.

what l dislike was they were  hard to put on my hand pulling them up they ripped at the top poor quality not durable over priced

You'll have to be carful when putting these on. I won't buy them again. With the virus running wild killing people why take the chance.

These gloves are HORRIBLE!!!  NO quality at all.  Way too thin and will break just trying to get them on.  Will never buy again.

Gloves cannot be used for normal work by my wifeThis product is misleading

Quality is not so good.

Inside box gloves are of different size . Very thin and hard to put on as it tears .

Break too easily

Terrible, rips every time you try to put them onStrongly do not recommend

This product is pure junk!! Don't waist your money! Very loose fitting around the wrist!!

I would not recommend rips trying to put on , cheap product

These gloves rip easily!  If you usually wear medium think about getting large. I previously purchased West Chester medium and they fit great!

Small and cheap and took forever to arrive.  I cannot tell you how tiny they are. Barely fit.  Rip easily.

This product smells like petroleum

They are listed as MEDIUM but barely fit my small hands.  DO NOT BUY.

These gloves are so thin it doesn't worth the price. Will not buy again.

These gloves tear easy at the wristThickness is ok but for some reason they rip easy

These are awful. The rubber breaks apart on your hands! I want a refund.

I've worked in ERs for twenty years. My medium gloves weren't medium. I don't recommend it,

Very disappointed with this glove, they rip when putting them on. Very poor material,  I wasted my money. POOR QUALITY!!!

Yo no e recibido ningún artículo.. es una estafa.. que disgusto, se aprovechan en estos tiempos .. 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 Quiero mi dinero...

This product is total garbage they rip really easily I was really disappointed 👎

The gloves are too bad. There are many broken gloves in the box

Wow breaks even putting it on ....Doesn’t protect nothing .....Have to wear like 4 gloves to go outside ....

Crap

gloves were cheap not well made. they tore as i was trying to put them on & i have small hands.

Ripped easily run small

Some gloves were already torn, and were burned or stained.

They break every time it’s put on

It’s broken when I received it. Worry about if someone already used it before. Disgusting...

Don't waste your money, these tore while putting them on.  They tore while only typing.  They are useless.

The are cheap quality

Se rompe con facilidad.No es confiable.Para uso de protección de las manos contra el VIRUS no lo recomiendo.

Caregivers for husband said they were poor quality.

Medium sizing is misleading, wouldn't even fit on my 12 year olds hands.

Did not like the quality of this product at all.

Very poor quality.  Tear easily when putting on.  Unsatisfactory

Smell so bad I had to return

Too tight - tears when putting on hand. My hand size is Medium. Also very thin. Not useful.

The worst gloves I have ever came across. Do not buy they rip easily!

I can burst this glove by blowing into it gently.

Have worn sm/med gloves for years, these ripped apart just trying to pull them on. Very disappointing.

It does break a part very easily. Cheap material.

Ripped immediately, then kept ripping and so forth. Nope!

They are small and tight

Very very small so they tear almost every time - also due to poor quality

Every time I put them on they rip!! also they run small .very disappointed with this gloves

Even for food service ability, these gloves were not the sturdiest.

Not worth for regilar use

Rips when you put them on. Size runs small.

Too thin. Would tear off while wearing itself

Too small.  Very thin, poor quality plastic.  While wearing, the plastic tears out.

Nunca me llego el pedido y me mandaron msj que ya estaba en mi casa

Do not waste your money

Waste of money

Very poor quality. and size are not matching

Such a thin material that they rip while putting them on. Zero quality gloves.

N ot a very smart  person !

Thank God these guys make gloves and not condoms.

Rip way too easily.

Terrible quality.

They tore while i put them on. Not a good buy.

Cheap material

Difficult to get on. Poor quality.

Tore easily

Horrible.. DO NOT BUY!

Super thin. They break before you put them on.

They rip when you put them on.  Not worth buying

First one out of the box ripped. More "crap" from China.

There were dirty gloves in the box.

Really bad material and many of them are damaged

Useless.  Can't get them on without tearing.

I will never order this again, what a rip-off.

Horrible item.

very poor quality break quickly

won't buy it again from this merchant

Never again

Rips immediately!

BAD

Terrible

Very poor quality

Very bad quality

Much too small.

These mediums are VERY small.  Be aware when you order

They stink like holy hell. Don't purchase. Gross.

These smell chemically

About 3/4 of the gloves tear as I try to put them on. The other 1/4 tear after the first 20 minutes I have them on.

THESE GLOVES ARE WORTHLESS.ONCE IN WATER THEY TAKE ON WATER SO YOUR HAND GET WET FAST.

Each pair I have tried to put on at least one has torn.  Not at all what I expected!

False advertising for delivery window. Weren't even shipped by the delivery date I was given. Stay away

Cheap and horrible quality.  Waste of money and time.

I don’t really like it, don’t feel comfortable and too expensive, the quality not acceptable.

These fragile gloves are a waste of money.  One must take great care when donning, or the cuff will tear. Several per box are already torn nearly in half. No quality control. Junk product.

Tears easily

My fingers keep popping through during cooking and I don't have long fingernails.

These gloves are are the worst every time you put them on use them one time and there is holes in them

These were just awful. I purchased these to help me put on my support hose. They are not flexible & are impossible to get on. I dug in my drawer for my old gloves

Gloves were bought for light cleaning. Material is cheap and tears easily.

Very thin gloves that ripped easily when you put them on. Waste of money. Had to throw so many away because they kept ripping when putting them on.

I'm a small woman my hand are not large got a medium and it is still too small. It also tear easy when you force your hand in.

It doesn't fit properly and quality is not good.

these gloves tear when you put them on not worth the money

Tear easily

Way to small order +2 higher, I usually order medium, with this brand I should of ordered XL.

As soon as i put the gloves on they rip from the thumb  They are bad quality. I am dissapointed

Terrible gloves  Ripped just putting on. Run very small too

Offert à ma petite-fille pour un calendrier de l'Avent (Une boule chaque jour jusqu'à Noël). La présentation est super et a bcp plu à ma petite-fille (11ans). Le Slime, comme chacun sait a ses inconvénients, celui-ci n'y échappe pas, j'en ai trouvé collé sur les draps et c'est difficile à détacher...

Ich hab die kleinen Schleimkugeln als Weihnachtsgeschenke an meine Vereinskinder verschenkt. Sie kamen super an! "Guck mal, die glitzern!" "Und da sind kleine Sachen drin!" Lediglich elastischer hätte ich sie erwartet.

Seems good deal but price went up after I last purchase, too bad . Have to find something else

You get many slimes, which is perfect for loot bags. However, they are very small and not much slime. Not a bad purchase but if I knew they would be this small, would have maybe considered something else.

Nicht zufrieden

Tut was es soll und wofür es ist.Gute Qualität und gutes Preis / Leistungsverhältnis.Gerne wieder.

Los compré para regalar a los compis de cole.Les gusto mucho. Ideal si quieres dar un detallito

Le ho usate come regalino da dare alle bimbe per il compleanno di mia figlia seguito giochini fatti, erano il premio. Hanno avuto un successo super

Très belle qualité et doux au toucher.  Se remet facilement dans son contenants et reprend sa forme

"The media could not be loaded.The galaxy slime comes in very tiny containers that are suitable for party favours only. The slime itself feels like mucous lol, the kids were kind of grossed out by it. Overall I feel like the product is overpriced."

These slimes are incredibly good, their consistency is great, no residues all over... The colours were fun for the kids and the ones with the charms were lots of fun! They stretch well with some massaging just as indicated in the pack, will have them in mind for other birthdays... They were a hit! My kids and friends love them!

Le sfere sono piccolette, lo slime e morbido ma non appiccica molto, ottimo perché non sorca gli abiti e si recupera bene. Alcune sfere hanno all'interno perline o animaletti, che piacciono alle bimbe. I colori sono vivaci e simpatici, prevalentemente sul blu e verde, ma anche rosa e arancio. Io le ho comprate come pensierino per i bimbi invitati alla festa di compleanno di mia figlia, avevano tutti tra 5 e 8 anni, e hanno apprezzato. Il prezzo è contenuto per il numero di perle presenti nella scatola: confezionate in una bella scatolina rettangolare colorata

The colours are really cool but the quality of the slime sucks. There’s no stretch and once it breaks apart it doesn’t go back together. Then you get these tiny pieces of slime everywhere. I won’t buy again. Wish I could return it but opened a few containers already. Do not recommend.

Ho acquistato queste palline per aggiungerle alla gift box di fine festa per gli amichetti di mio figlio.  Nonostante alcune recensioni negative sulla consistenza dello slime,  ho rischiato, le ho scelte perché sembrano dei piccoli pianeti e sembravano perfette per il tema Spazio che avevamo scelto. Beh, siamo stati fortunati perché, oltre che davvero molto carine, lo slime all’interno aveva un’elasticità è una consistenza perfette.

Ich habe diese Schleimkugeln für meine Tochter bestellt. Sie hat sich sehr darüber gefreut. Gut finde ich, dass es einzelne Kugeln sind und man nicht auf einmal einen riesen Schleimbatzen hat. So kann man immer mal eine Kugel öffnen und den " Schleim" nachdem Spielen wieder in der Kugel verstauen. Er sieht auch sehr schön aus und hat teilweise kleine Figuren drin. Was nicht so toll ist, dass er etwas chemisch riecht und man den Schleim leider nicht so ziehen kann, wie beschrieben. Er ist relativ fest und bricht schnell auseinander. Er klebt auch super auf Teppichen u.ä. Also hier aufpassen!

Der Slime reißt leicht, damit tut er nicht was zu erwarten ist. Und er riecht stark nach Chemie. Daher nicht empfehlenswert.Nette Farben immerhin.

The price is a little high for the size

Il prodotto sembra vecchio, poco elastico, non è come il classico slime. Non ho fatto il reso solo perché mia figlia l'aveva già visto e ha voluto subito giocarci. Non si sbriciola ma ha la consistenza della plastilina e non degli slime. Saró stato io sfortunato... Non consiglio l'acquisto.

Die Kinder haben sich sehr über die Bälle gefreut. Einige wenige Bälle hatten kleine Perlen im Schleim. Sie wurdem am Kindergeburtstag verteilt. Leider ist der Schleim aber alles andere als Fluffy und der Geruch ist auch nicht der beste. Die Konsistenz erinnert eher an Knete und er bröckelt recht schnell.

Un producto que me ha sorprendido, usado en fiesta infantil y los niños encantados, las bolas eran mas grandes de lo que me imaginaba, no son enormes pero estan bastante bien de tamaño. Recomendado sin duda como regalo de fiesta.

Wir haben diese Kugeln als Giveaways für den Kindergeburtstag meiner 8 jährigen Rochter gekauft. Alle fanden es super.

Beautiful colours

Wide assortment keeps my child busy

I ordered this for my (almost) 3 year old daughter who LOVES slime. She was SO excited to open the pack and see 24 little tubs of slime, and immediately grabbed 4 tubs to open. As soon as she took the first one out of the package a piece fell off. She was in near tears and she "broke" the slime.  We grabbed another tub and when she tried to stretch the slime, it just ripped off. If she squeezed it, it broke into a million pieces, and she got tiny little globs of slime everywhere. She was so disappointed.  I recall reading some decently positive reviews, so I scrolled through and found a review that says you just have to work it in.  So I grabbed the slime from her, and "kneaded" the slime for 15 minutes.  Not only was it now in a million pieces all over my floor, my hands were covered in the galaxy slime, and it looks like something my dog would have thrown up. If you leave it to "rest", it all comes back together and has a nice sparkle to it.  So it's a nice "look but don't touch" slime... but who gets slime to just look at??I guess the positive side of the slime is that it looks pretty, so good to gift away, because it's not something I would want in my house.

Nicht gut

Comprate come regalino per gli invitati ad una festa di compleanno, le palline sono veramente carine e ben fatte. Lo slime all'interno non fa cattivo odore e non sporca né macchia, non si sbriciola né si attacca ai vestiti. Le consiglio

Per il prezzo speso vanno più che bene. Sono come delle palline di ping pong. Si aprono e dentro c'è lo slime. Non è elastico al massimo ma ha dei bei colori..

Idée cadeau pour ma fille mais convient mieux pour un cadeau de kermesse Etc .. car il y a 24 petites balles avec un slime dedans , il y a des couleurs différentes mais bon pour la même personne ça n’est pas utile d’avoir 24 boules

Consegna puntuale,i 24pezzi sono variegati ,non troppo colorati,ma con alcuni pezzi (4/5) più  da femmina con glitter,paperelle,fiorellini. Ideali per me che devo impacchettarli insieme ad alcune caramelle come regalino post party. La dimensione è più o meno di una pallina da ping-pong. Le parole del mio bimbo quasi cinquenne:<< lo slime è perfetto,non appiccica,brilla e profuma di sole 😅>>

I was very disappointed as these slimes were hard when they were received. You could kind of stretch them but they would break. It definitely did not have the texture of slime that I was expecting.

Wir haben den Schleim als Mitgebsel/Beschäftigung zum Schulanfang gekauft. Er ist in kleinen Plastikkugeln verpackt, diese liegen in einem Karton mit Platzhaltern. Die Farben sind schön. Der Schleim riecht nicht und klebt nicht, hinterlässt keine Schleimdpuren auf Tisch ect.. Wenn er geknetet wird, wird er etwas fester und kann als Kugel auch springen. Man kann ihn zerteilen und er fügt sich schnell wieder zu einer Masse zusammen.Die leeren Kugeln gehen leider etwas schnell kaputt. Wir haben dann in Plastikeier umgepackt. Auch nach 3 Monaten ist der offene Schleim noch top.Es hatten nicht nur die Kinder Spaß. ;)Ich würde ihn auch nochmal kaufen.

Do not buy this productThe slime is low quality it breaks apart and makes a mess all over the houseThe slime also comes on tiny shot glass cups not as advertised.

Hallo,Wir haben es für unsere Tochter zum Geburtstag bestellt.Es ist vollständig und unbeschadet bei uns angekommen.Es ist bei unsere Tochter und den anderen Kindern ( Geschwister und Gäste) sehr gut angekommen. Auch wir Erwachsenen konnten nicht die Finger davon lassen.Ich kenne noch den Gliebber von meiner Kindheit und der Geruch ( der schon etwas eigenwillig ist) hat mich sofort in meiner kindheitserinnerung versetzt.Minimal klebrig... Daher zu empfehlen es nicht auf Teppiche, decken, oder sandige Untergrund zu bespielen.Was sehr schön ist :Die FarbenGute einzelne Portionsgrössen ( zum teilen wichtig😉)Der extra Glipper in der untersten Reihe der durchsichtig ist und kleinere Gegenstände eingearbeitet ist..... machen das Set vollständig und lassen für uns keine spielwünsche offen.Das einzige was etwas schade ist:Der Gliebber ist ja in einzelne kreisrunde Plastikbehälter porzioniert ( was ja sehr schön ist) doch das Plastik ist sehr dünn und spröde.... Was zu Folge hat das es bei minimalen druck kaputt geht..... und somit die Aufbewahrung des Gliebber etwas schwieriger macht.Tip hier: Wir haben uns da mit leere ü-eier geholfenWir sind bis auf den kleinen Verpackungs sache sehr zufrieden und geben wegen dem spielspass und der Menge an Gliebber 5 SterneIch hoffe die Bewertung hilft euchLg

Stinken zwar chemisch,  macht sich dennoch in der Mitbringsel- Tüte gut.

Acquistati come gadget per la festa di compleanno del mio bambino di 6 anni.Il regalo è piaciuto molto ai bimbi che alle bimbe. Ci sono diverse varietà alcune palline sono glitterate altre invece contengono al loro interno piccoli oggetti come stelline, cuoricini o paperelle. Le palline sono un po’ piccole rispetto alle aspettative. In ogni caso fanno la loro bella figura

Ce n’est pas le type de slime qui se recolle si vous la séparer elle n’adhère plus ensemble et vite ça devient plein de petit morceau et ça fait beaucoup de dégât. En plus les pots sont minuscule.

Sono molto belli e il più importante è che non sono troppo mole e non si attaccano ai vestiti

If you try to stretch up you have to do it very slowly otherwise is going to break in parts, so for toddlers, I won't recommend, also you can't mix colours, so you have to play carefully with it if you want to keep all colours

Not stretchy at all and breaks easily

Es un slime bastante duro y las bolas son pequeñas, del tamaño de una pelota de Ping Pong. Por lo demás son muy bonitas y dos de ellas traen un pequeño muñequito

Kam super an als Gastgeschenke bei der Geburtstagsfeier meines Sohnes.

Non è slime, si spacca in tanti pezzi.Per quanto le palline siano carine, l’articolo è vecchio. Sicuramente non è uno slime.Restituito.

High quality slime, in hard wearing globe containers.Beautiful colours, with no ball looking exactly the same.Slime is easy to handle and not at all sticky, so not found clung to items everywhere!Only small criticism, is it might be nice to have a few of the random balls in  there, the o es with the added confetti etc, or themed slimes, but as it is called galaxy slime I suppose these ones will be less apparent!All in all a great buy and would buy again.

Habe ich für meine Schüler geholt, sie haben sich gefreut, war an sich alles in Ordnung aber ich finde das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis ein wenig unverhältnismäsig. Insgesamt ein wenig zu teuer, den Kindern gefällt es aber.

Ich habe die Kugeln als Mitgebsel zum Kindergeburtstag meiner 6- jährigen Tochter bestellt. Die Lieferung kam schnell und unbeschädigt an. Die Kugeln waren der Renner bei den Kindern. Sie kamen supergut an.Nach ein paar Tagen jedoch finde ich überall Klebespuren von den Schleimkugeln. In der Artikelbeschreibung steht, dass der Slime keine Klebespuren hinterlässt, doch das tut er definitiv! Auf Kissen und Kleidung und und und....Mit der normalen Wäsche ist es nicht rausgegangen, worüber ich mich jetzt im Nachhinein sehr ärgere.

Non sono buoni sono secchi e piccolissimi

Sehr gutes Material

Non è per niente elastico, si spezza e le palline sono piccolissime

Good

I bought the slime kit for my slime obsessed granddaughter , I wanted some thing different , unique gift and my granddaughter loved it , the slime is not sticky and the little gifts inside some of the pods is such an extra bonus !!! So pleased with this kit . Highly recommended

Ordered these as favours for my daughters birthday coming up in a couple days.  When I received the product, box was beat up a bit and half empty.  Returning immediately.  Re-bought because her heart was set on these, lets hope it doesn't happen again!

Rigolo ce slime dans les petites sphères  en plastique dommage que beaucoup de couleur se ressembleParfait pour un anniversaire

Acheté octobre pour un anniversaireTous allait bien au débutEt depuis on met petit à petit le slim à la poubelleIl mousse ça dégouline des boîtes il pue de plus en plusC'est immondePour le prix c'est cher

La cara de mi peque cuando los vió fue un poema. Es un pack perfecto para tener un detalle con los peques tras un cumple y no dar siempre la bolsa de chuches.Vienen 24 bolitas de plástico redondas, con diferentes colores de slime, algunos espaciales, otros transparentes y unos cuantos con alguna sorpresa dentro (minipatitos)El único pero es que hay que ir con cuidado, porque las manchas de este slime no se quitan, se endurecen en los tejidos cuando se secan y no hay manera humana de sacarlos.Y por tejidos me refiero a ropa y también a tapicerías de coche..Aún así, muy bonitos

Erster Eindruck süß und klein. Toll ist das jede galaxy noch einmal extra verpackt ist.Eine tolle Farbwahl, lebendige schöne Farben. Dann nach der ersten geöffneten galaxy wurde ich leider süchtig. Dachte ja weil Chinaware meist stinkt und Chemie und so.... Aber dieser Geruch von dem slime ist der hammer. Kennt ihr diese citronen Armbänder gegen mücken? So duftet der slime. Eine citronengalaxy. Wunderbar ist auch das der slime nicht an der Hand oder Kleidung klebt. Somit darf auch mal die jüngste (3 Jahre) mal mit slimen.

I was silly enough to ignore some bad reviews. Thinking there are just as many good ones!! Don’t be fooled.I purchased 2 sets one for my nieces & one for my daughter. Totally just shy of £35 for two sets........These “slimes” are no longer slime....... I believe at one point they would have been “slime” but clearly these have been stored in the wrong environment (that’s My guess due to them been so cold on opening tubes) & they have turned to gel that just tears apart.I was gutted for my 2 year old who’s taken a big liking to my nieces slime collection. These are stunning..... very pretty and eye catching......... but aren’t any good for kids to play with unless they like crumbling useless Gel.Thankfully I got my money back on both sets as I returned them as they aren’t fit for purpose for sure.

Le palline di slime sono piaciute tanto ai bambini a cui le abbiamo regalate per intrattenersi durante una festa di compleanno. Peccato purtroppo che i colori non rispecchino quelli delle foto, sono molto più spenti ma i bambini ci fanno meno caso di noi! Non si attaccano facilmente in giro e questo è un vantaggio, attenti solo a non pestarle...

Kind ist begeistert. Wir haben einen Adventskalender daraus gemacht. Der Schleim ist eine gute Qualität. Niedlich versehen mit kleinen Teilchen, wie Perlen und.s.w.. Gerne wieder.

I'm going to buy more! I bought them as party bag fillers and I love those! The slime smells nice and doesn't get sticky or dirty. It leaves a wet feeling on your hands that lasts a few seconds but no residue.  It is honestly the best slime I have found! And the galaxy balls really look amazing in colour.I really recommend!

These slime balls are great. They are more like a putty rather than slime, my girls are 3 & 8 and they love them.Perfect for little ones however there are some small bits & pieces in the 5 clear/colour slimes so I'd advise adult supervision if like my 3 year old, they like to put things in their mouth.

I have no idea why kids love these slimes so much, but I'm happy it gives so much joy to children. Good quality product and those slimes are very fun to play with as well. Your child won't be disappointed. :D

Dieser Artikel war nicht mehr als 5€ wert. Unverschämtheit, ihn derart teuer zu veräußern.Ich war erschrocken beim auspacken, als ich die Ware sah.Die Sterne gerne ich nur für die reibungslose und schnelle Abwicklung was die Rücksendung/Reklamation angeht

Sehr schön und gut , wieder gerne kaufen

Die Dinger sind ganz lustig. Auch richtig slimig scheint aber nicht zu kleckern.Leider kam es dazu, dass die Dinger nach ein paar Tagen im Döschen übelst gestunken haben. Richtig widerlich.

Nur nett anzusehen.Slime nicht wie man es kennt. Lässt sich nicht ziehen, reißt sofort und lässt sich dann nicht wieder zusammen kneten.  Geruch ist erträglich.Nach einiger Zeit nicht Nutzung wollte meine kleine wieder mit ihrem slime spielen, leider mit großer Enttäuschung. Slime hat wurde sehr flüssig, stank und war nur noch gut für die Mülltonne. Kommt Slime mit Decken, Kleidung, Teppich oder sonstiges aus Stoff in Berührung bekommt man es nur sehr mühsam entfernt oder garnicht.Werde es nicht wieder holen und würde es auch nicht weiterempfehlen.

Il prodotto è ottimo soprattutto se messo in paragone con alcuni Slime che esistono in commercio e che sono molto più pubblicizzati. Il prodotto Infatti non appiccica non incolla Ha un buon profumo I colori sono molto apprezzati dai bambini. Inoltre essendo in quantità così piccole richiudibili lo Slime non si secca e si può anche dilazionare il regalo nel tempo senza doverlo aprire tutto insieme.  assolutamente consigliato

Carinissime palline usate per prepare i gadget di fine festa. Ogni pallina ha un diametro di 3 cm circa. Non sono tutte brillantino se ma alcune sono trasparenti con pezzetti di frutta. Quindi le volete tutte dello stesso tema dovrete prendere più confezioni

Meilleur jeu de slime pour ma fille

Distrutto in poche ore dalla bambina. Poco resistente

Also, das Paket kam gerade an. Bin wirklich begeistert. Diese Slimekugel sehen wirklich toll aus. Habe mich mit der Bestellung ja etwas schwer getan weil es ja (nur) ein Gastgeschenk sein soll und ich es zusammen mit den anderen Dingen nicht zu teuer werden lassen wollte, aber es lohnt sich. Hier ist alles bombenfest. Nix läuft aus. Sieht absolut toll aus. Und sie haben eine wirklich ausreichende Grösse. Klar grösser geht immer aber im Preis Leistung gesehen .....Top.Wurde auch super schnell geliefert. Gestern bestellt, heute da.

Ich habe ein paar der Kugeln mit in die Überraschungstüten beim Kindergeburtstag getan. Die Freude war groß. Ich empfindet es allerdings mehr als Knete als Schleim. Und der Preis ist auch zu hoch. Trotzdem ein vielseitiges Spielzeug.

Ich habe diesen Galaxy Slime meiner Tochter zum Geburtstag gekauft leider ist es nicht wirklich ein Slime. Er reißt extrem schnell auch wenn er aufgewärmt ist und ist von der Beschaffenheit eher hart nicht schleimig so wie Slime eigentlich sein müsste.Meine Tochter hat trotzdem Spaß dran gefunden und das ist die Hauptsache.Aber kaufen würde ich Ihn nicht nochmal.

Enkel fahren voll drauf ab :-) Sind aber Besser als die großen Quetschkugeln. Finde aber die sehr kleinen Innereien der Kugeln nicht schön. Die größeren Innenteile gehen aber.

Ho acquistato queste palline come regalo di fine festa per il compleanno di mia figlia da distribuire ai suoi amichetti. Le palline di slime sono veramente molto carine e colorate. É stata mia figlia a sceglierle.

Kann noch nichts sagen, kommt in den Weihnachtskalender

im ersten Moment sieht es aus und fühlt es sich an wie man es sich vorstellt, doch beim kneten bricht der slime und bröckelt auseinander. sehr schade :/

Ich habe damit den Adventskalender meiner Tochter befüllt. Das ganze kam super an. Die einzelnen Kugeln gehen nur leider super schnell kaputt und dann schleimt alles voll.

Tanto apprezzato

ich persönlich mag die Kugeln gar nicht, da sie mir teilweise einfach viel zu glitschig sind. ich bevorzuge eher den Schleim, der zwar schleimig ist, aber nicht so extrem an den Fingern klebt, wie dieser. die Farben sind schön, aber der Rest ist nicht meins. würde es nicht nochmal kaufen.

Un juguete muy entretenido, comprado para jugarlo con mi sobrino, y al final me he divertido tanto como él.Se hace divertido ir abriendo cada bola e ir descubriendo los diferentes colores de cada uno.Algunas son más elásticas o más pegajosas que otras, van mejorando el tacto después de jugar un rato con ellas, ya que se van calentando.  Pasados unos días nos entró la curiosidad de mezclar algunas bolas y crear nuevos colores. Hay diversión para rato!

Würde unter Adventskalender angepriesen. 24 einzelne Kugeln mit Schleim, der beim ersten Ziehen reißt. Sehr enttäuschend

Confacente alle aspettative

Im großen und Ganzen super! Nur leider war eine der Slimekugeln in der Packung kaputt und ist ausgelaufen...somit ein ganz klein wenig Enttäuschung beim Kind. Ansonsten ist das Produkt toll und kommt gut an!

Salve,stupende e pratiche, ho preso queste palline di slime per mio figlio, sono rimasta prima io colpito dalla alta qualità del prodotto e dalla fatto di essere così vari colori e tipologie che non si stanca mai di giocare. come si vede in foto, sono colorate, trasparenti, con le perline, con le paparelle, tanti modelli e tanti modi di giocare che stiamo ormai giocando solo a questo. Poi lo slime è davvero un gioco carino e facile da fare che sono davvero soddisfatto da questo articolo. lo consiglio

Prodotto vecchio, secco

Slime un peu caoutchouc, ma facile a magner...mais ma fille reste quand même contente

Diese Knete ist richtig super, wir lieben sie, sie bleibt nicht kleben, man kann super damit spielen, auch die kleinen Obststücke und Entchen sind super süß. Einfach perfekt.

Bought as prizes for kid’s competition. Awesome little pockets of slime and sparkle.If you like that kind of thing.Which I don’t.But hey- doing it for the kids....they loved them.Their parent’s probably hate me.Modern day dilemma.

Tiene olor agradable, no se Mancha. Pero no es elástico. Colores bonitos. Lo he comprado para la piñata. Es juguete para una fiesta, para el uso continuo no sirve

Habe das Produkt  hier im Angebot  gekauftIch muss  sagen  es ist toll  ist gut zum Geburtstag  angekommen

Alles super und ein tolles Mitgebsel

An sich ganz witzig aber viele gleiche Bälle. Größe ist perfekt und schleim ok.

I got these to help with toilet training my 5 year old autistic daughter .. she love slime and these are perfect for an award when she uses the toilet

La confezione sembra perfetta, tante palline colorate che invogliano al gioco. Se si apre la pallina però la delusione è grande, non è slime ma un sorta di plastilina che si rompe durante il gioco. Sconsiglio l'acquisto

Könnte mehr vielfältiger sein  . Sonst hat das Kind viel Spaß damit gehabt .

Dem Titel nach sollte es sich um einen Adventskalender handeln, nun ja es sind 24 Kugeln drinnen, stimmt, aber es ist einfach eine offene Box wo man sofort alle Kugeln sieht. Ohne Türchen, ohne Nummern, ohne Überraschung. Das ist sehr schade!

È  piaciuto molto perché ci sono tantissimi slime, certo non  molto filanti, ma cmq per un bambino appassionato va più che bene

Great for party bags!

Die Kugeln sind sweet, sie sind so klein das sie in einen Adventskalender passen. Für Kinder unter 6 Jahren allerdings nicht geeignet, es gibt Schleim der kleine Teile enthält und leicht zu verschlucken sind.

Ich habe als Adventskalender für meinen Sohn gekauft und er war sehr zufrieden

Alles Schick!

Se casse en pleins de petits morceaux et inutilisable

Es ist für ein Kindergeburtstag der Hit. Es ist aber nicht die beste Qualität. Es sind sehr schöne Farben. Der Schleim riecht aber ein bisschen komisch. Aber Kindern gefällt es.

They are tiny, not worth price.

tutto perfetto solo le dimensioni un pò contenute

Sehr schön, nur muss der Schleim richtig geknetet werden bevor man ihn ziehen kann. Riecht sehr chemisch...

Meine Kinder lieben Schleim und deshalb habe ich ihnen zum Kindertag dieses große Packung Schleimbälle bestellt. Es gibt 24 verschiedene Modelle, teilweise mit Figuren. Der Schleim leuchtet in den schönsten Farben. Wir bewahren den Schleim in den gelieferten Kugeln auf. Ein toller Spaß für Groß und Klein.

⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟Wir haben die Slimes als kleine Abschiedsgeschenke für die Geburtstagsparty unserer kleinen gekauft.Die Slimes sind einzeln in kleinen Kugel verpackt und noch zusätzlich verschweißt. Die Farbgestaltungen sindrichtig schön Galaxy-mäßig :-)Alle Kids sind happy und Slimy nach Hause gegangen.⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟

It was really small and watery I wouldn’t recommend it for that price you pay

Simpatico ed ottimo per il regalino da donare  agli invitati di un compleanno , solo forse un po’ piccoli .

Article perimé depuis juin, donc slime sec...certaine boules dont le film protecteur est manquant donc déjà ouvert, des boules qui fuient, à moitié remplie, cassée, etc, etc, etc, on peut en supposer plein de choses, article qui a déjà été renvoyé mais qu'on propose quand même à d'autres clients? On sait jamais, sur un malentendu...J'ai voulu me fier au commentaires positifs, je n'aurai pas dû.. c'est tellement aléatoire finalement... j'ai joué j'ai perdu.C'était pour remplir le calendrier de l'avent de ma fille qui adooooore le slime, avec plein d'autre petites bricoles, 24 c'était parfait. Heureusement que je m'y prend tôt, mais je n'ai clairement pas envie de tenter l'expérience de nouveau, même avec un autre vendeur.Conclusion, 1 étoile par rapport à mon expérience.Encore une fois, c'est très aléatoire...

Prodotto molto apprezzato da mio figlio ...unica pecca e non da poco gli slime trasparenti ovvero quelli non metallizzati li ho dovuti buttare perché si appiccicavano alle mani in mille pezzi invece che rimanere un corpo unico rendendolo ingiocabile ....per quelli metallizzati tutto ok

Cadeau pour une fillette de 9 ans. Très satisfaite

Keine Ahnung wofür man sowas braucht, aber meine Tochter liebt es nunmal....sieht jedenfalls schön aus und klebt nicht an der Kleidung oder ähnlichem fest.

I bought these as party bag fillers, I expected them to be a decent size because of product images - but they were tiny. Party was a space theme so these were meant to fit that, by randomly 6 out of 24 were just pink glittery. So so overpriced, Tesco do a better version for a fraction of the cost.

Etwas schade das die Kugeln so lieb los verpackt sind aber sonst super kleben nicht und Schleimen auch nicht. Trotzdem super zum kneten und Formen

Un regalo con el que sorprendí a los peques! Mantiene la elasticidad incluso si se olvida una noche de cerrarlo!! Son geniales!

je suis très satisfaite de ce slime, en effet, il n'a pas de mauvaise odeur, il ne sèche pas vite et le conditionnement dans les petites boules est très pratique pour le partager avec plusieurs enfants. les couleurs sont jolies et scintillantes

Meine Tochter mag den Slime gerne. Die Farben sind schön, er klebt nicht an den Händen und riecht nicht so intensiv wie vergleichbare Produkte

Sono piaciuti tantissimo, fatti bene, non incollano, sembrano tutti uguali ma in realtà sono diversi e comunque tanti, quindi bellissimi come regalo!

Purtroppo appiccica. Sono pochi che non appiccicano (i crystal). Pero almeno si pulisce in fretta da qualsiasi superficie o supporto..

Mein Sohn freut sich darüber in seinem Adventskalender... allerdings befinden sich darin kleine Glasscherben. Das ist gefährlich und sollte so nicht verkauft werden.

No es exactamente slime (no es tan estirable), pero a cambio no mancha ni es pegajoso. Los colores muy bonitos, y el tamaño de las bolas es más grande de lo que esperábamos. Muy bien por lo que cuesta

Bastante entretenido, sin embargo, algo si queanchan, y algunas de las jelly's de la caja estaban pasadas y algo duras. De hecho es cierto que si las trabajas se reblandece, pero algunas ni a tiros, estaba secas y se partian

"The media could not be loaded.Ich habe den slime gekauft als Gastgeschenk für einen Kinder Geburtstag.Ich bin sehr begeistert von diesem slim.Er ist vom Geruch sehr angenehm.Man kann ihn auseinander reißen und er geht ohne Probleme wieder zusammen kneten.Die Farben und das Glitzer ist mega schön.Die Kinder waren begeistert."

Sehr kleine Schleime in Kugeln. Der Schleim riecht sehr streng und ist teil gar nicht so schleimig und dehnbar.Waren für die Mitgebtüten zu einem Kindergeburtstag.

Produkt ist top, die Kinder haben sich gefreut

hay que tocarlas mucho para que sean slime..pero tienen unos colores muy bonitos.Eran para regalo y nos las hemos quedado...con éso digo todo..jeje

Regalato alla mia bimba di 5 anni che è rimasta più che contenta....bella l'idea di separare lo Slime in 24 palline tutte coloratissime ...ottimo anche il prodotto che non risulta appiccicoso come altri Slime di diverse marche ...facile da riarotolare e conservare nelle apposite palline di plastica che ne conservano la consistenza anche dopo diversi giorni.. consigliatissimo!!

Les enfants ont étaient ravie de découvrir le slime galaxy Ball.Moi aussi aucune odeur 24 couleurs différentes aucun danger pour les enfants.Très simple d utilisation alors si vous voulez faire plaisir aux enfants n hésitez pas le cadeau parfais.

Super slime...Verklebt nicht, die Kinder haben eine Freude

Tolles Geschenk, meine Tochter (9) liebt Schleim und dieser Schleim riecht gut und ist von der Konsistenz genau richtig,bleibt nicht kleben und zum kneten gut geeignet. Würde ich wieder kaufen.

Der Versand war wie gewohnt schnell, leider war der Karton leicht zerdrückt. Als mitgebsel auf den Kindergeburtstag kam es gut an. Würde den aber nicht nochmal bestellen.

God child liked this, personally think a little over priced

Gerne wieder

Ich habe es meine Tochter geschenkt die Freude war riesig, mir war wichtig das der slime nicht klebt und das tut er auch nicht! Super Geschenk auch zum verschenken. Wirklich tolle slimes!

Absolut unbrauchbarLeider!Habe eben erst beim Befüllen des Adventskalenders bemerkt, dass der Schleim alles andere als schleimig ist. Er ist extrem krümlig und auch durch längeres kneten und wärmen wird es nicht besser. Wenn ich es eher geprüft hätte hätte ich sofort reklamiert so bin ich leider über der Zeit...absoluter Fehlkauf

Bin etwas enttäuscht, da der Karton verbeult war, als wenn er schon ein paar mal benutzt wurde. Es soll ein Geschenk für meine 10 Jahre alte Enkelin sein. Hab es mir anders vorgestellt.

schnelle lieferung, paket war am 2. tag schon da. meine tochter kann stundenlang damit spielen. geruch an die finger ist angenehm, sehr leicht. schöne farbe. ist ein sauberer ersatz zu knete. super spiel zurzeit bei ausgangssperre.

usati come regalo per gli invitati alla festa di compleanno hanno riscosso tanto successo. Lo slime non puzza e resta elastico e umido anche dopo l'uso. Le palline che contengono il prodotto si rompono facimente. Alcuni slime contengono dei piccoli oggetti ( fruttini paperelle perline ) e li rendono ancora più interessanti per i bambini. CONSIGLIATO

Der Slime ist heute (05.01.2021) bei uns angekommen und laut Verpackung seit dem 06.01.2020 abgelaufen. Dementsprechend ist er ausgetrocknet und kein Slime mehr sondern mehr wie Knete.

Excellent service item arrived in two days from placing the order. Thank you

Leider war es nicht wie erwartet und auch nicht wie normaler Slime. Die Masse war eher mit weicher Knete zu vergleichen. Schade.

Leider waren nur 23 Stück drin statt 24...meine Tochter war enttäuscht

Es gab strahlende kinderaugen und es macht super viel spaß mit dem schleim zu spielen  :)  top  !

Also für mich ist es kein Schleim sondern eher Gelee! Es ist leider nicht so toll wie wir es gedacht haben.

Ich habe für meine Tochter einen Adventskalender gebastelt wo sie jeden Tag eine Schleimkugel hat. Wir haben heute den 5. Dezember und eine Schleimkugel ist schon hart die anderen fangen an zu stinken . Sie ist echt enttäuscht! Dafür ist der Preis einfach viel zu hoch . Wir können die Kugeln definitiv nicht weiter empfehlen !!!

Après plusieurs semaines d'utilisations,  hélas je suis obligée de retirer des étoiles,  comme un autre commentaire je suis au regret de dire que le slim s'abîme avec le temps, même les boules non ouvertes :-(  et une odeur apparaît je suis un donc un déçu par rapport a l'ouverture et les premières utilisations de ce dernier....

Die Flummi Slimes sind in Ordnung

Naja...

I bought this set of slime for my sons birthday, I can’t wait to see his face. The packaging is very neat and the colours of the slime look amazing!

Perfekt als Mitgebsel für jeden Kindergeburtstag. Kein geklebe oder rum gematsche

Además de parecerme muy pequeño, y si bien es cierto que es bonito y original no cumple su función. Los niños esperan elasticidad, que se deslice de manera viscosa y sin pegarse (esto último los padres...). Pues se rompe como si nada es como si fuese una plastilina pero no se moldea... No funciona... Una pena.

Nach einem Tag leider ausgetrocknet.Ist meiner Ansicht nach rausgeworfenes Geld,Auch wenn es sich erst super toll anfühlt.

Wir haben es als Geburtstagsmitgebsel für unseren 9 jährigen Sohn gekauft. Seine Freunde waren begeistert. Es hat eine angenehme Konsistenz un einen angenehmen Geruch. Wir können es nur weiterempfehlen.

Really good gift for my son, he is enjoying a lot! it's not as sticky as I thought yet seems. Would avoid carpets, hair and good clothes

Nicht individuell genug.Übel riechende.Lauft teilweise aus.Aber ein hinkuger für kleine Geschänke.

Beinhaltet 18 Kugeln Galaxy Slime und 6 Kugeln mit durchsichtigem Slime mit Deko (Perlen, Früchte und ein mit 2 Enten) die Galaxy Slime Kugeln enthalten ungefähr 27g Slime und die andere 22 bis 26g. Meine Tochter hat es sehr gut gefallen. Zum weiterempfehlen.

Tutto ok!grazie

My son loved them even though we thought it was a advent calendar

Bimbi felici

Lo slime da vedere é molto bello una volta aperte le palline però il contenuto é poco elastico rispetto ad altri slime in commercio.

So ist das Produkt gut aber die Verpackung total verdrückt und gerissen!!

Regalo perfecto para los más peques, no mancha ni se pega en ropa ni superficies, ideal, además trae una gran variedad para más diversión.Mis niñas están encantadas!!!

Super Produkt

Come da foto. Ok

Alla fine sono più o meno dello stesso colore a parte quelle trasparenti

The slime was very bad ,it ripped a lot and was not good to play with , I would not get this and my husband, daughters , and cousins agree .

"The media could not be loaded.Really disappointed with this product, nothing like the description, very brittle and not in the least bit stretchy. I want a full refund!"

Un producto estupendo. Al peque le ha encantado. La caja es fuerte y una presentación muy bonita. Montones de slime con mini figuritas dentro. Súper chulo, sin duda compraré otro para regalo.

Als Geburtstagsgeschenk für meine Hortkinder auf Arbeit kamen sie gut an...

👍

Funktioniert irgendwie so gar nicht... Ziehen wie Schleim geht nicht, denn dann reist der Schleim sofort auseiander... Schade

Not opened any of the balls yet but product looks amazing

Wir haben die Schleimkugeln als Mitgebsel für den Kindergeburtstag gekauft.. Kam gut an.. Im Schleim sind ganz kleine Sachen versteckt.. Blümchen, Sterne...

Ho comprato il kit per avere a disposizione dei regalini da dare a fine festa. Le palline erano ben confezionate, lo slime (all'interno) è morbido, si allunga moltissimo e non appiccica. Tutto perfettamente corrispondente alla descrizione. Consiglio l'acquisto

Anche io do 5 stelle a questo prodotto. Non sporca, anzi si manipola benissimo e ha un buonissimo profumo.18 sfere contengono slime metallizzato mentre le altre 6 sono leggermente colorate con all'interno delle perline.Consiglio vivamente l'acquisto.

Es ist kein Kalender! Es sind 24 Slimes in Plastikkugeln.Teils riecht der Slime stark parfümiert und fängt nach ein paar Tagen ganz extrem an zu riechen - sehr chemisch, beissend.

Super slim. Très jolies boules!

Simpatico presente per fine compleanno

Geniales Mitgebsel für den Kindergeburtstag unserer Tochter. Die Kinder waren begeistert. Schleim ist bei Kindern, warum auch immer, der absolute Hit.

Una idea genial para jugar entre varios niños

Pacco arrivato puntuale, lo slime all’interno delle sfere è ottimo finalmente ho risentito l’odore del vecchio slime... il primo di colore verde per intenderci. Molle quanto basta si gioca correttamente, al momento sono rimaste tutte morbide ed umide le sfere aperte

Está bien para detalle de cumpleaños

Absolute waste of time, nothing like pictures, it just broke in half and all the little beads bell out, I noticed it was really cold so either where it’s been stored has made it defective, or out of date, the label in it had spelling mistakes, I was so dissapointed bought for my daughters birthday good job I decided to open one of the balls to check it, I wouldn’t of wanted to see her upset.

Le ha chiflado a mi hijo de 5 años

Looks good but unfortunately the price tag doesn't match the quality. No matter how much you move it around and warm it up it just rips into chunks. Frustrated mum.

le palline di stime sono coloratissime e diverse tra loro. si adattano sia a bambini che bambine. ogni pallina e singolarmente sigillata

Carino il packaging,  ma a parte quelli trasparenti con gli oggetti dentro, sono tutti dello stesso colore, mio figlio è rimasto deluso

Die Kugeln können, sobald man sie geöffnet hat, nicht wieder verschlossen werden. Somit trocknet der Schleim nach dem ersten Benutzen aus und kann nur noch weggeschmissen werden. Leider nur ein sehr kurzer Spaß für die Kinder.

Bello come in foto

In der Beschreibung und auf der Verpackung steht 24 Stück Inhalt, als es geöffnet wurde waren aber 7 Felder leer und nur 17 Stück enthalten! Warum? War ziemlich peinlich weil es von uns verschenkt wurde!

Wer an Schleim denkt, sollte die Finger von dem Produkt lassen.Da zieht sich gar nichts, sondern bricht.

Macht sehr Spaß damit zu kneten :-) gefällt uns gut

Leider sind meine Slimes wie in anderen Rezensionen auch ebenfalls vor einem Jahr abgelaufen.. das merkt man auch an der Qualität,  sie sehen zwar hübsch auch, sind aber nicht mehr elastisch und auch zu hart.... reißen, wenn man sie außeinander zieht:(Schade!

Hätte mir mehr versprochen, das Set geht zurück! Der Schleim ist nicht zäh sondern reißt und bricht!

"The media could not be loaded.Der Slime ist heute (05.01.2021) bei uns angekommen und laut Verpackung seit dem 07.01.2020 abgelaufen. Dementsprechend ist er ausgetrocknet und kein Slime mehr sondern mehr wie Knete."

Offert en cadeau de départ lors de l'anniversaire de ma fille, les enfants étaient vraiment ravis. Merci

Llego rápido y en perfectas condiciones. Lo use para regalar y a los peques les encanto.Lo que más les ha gustado son los animalitos, bolitas y demás cositas que trae el slime dentro.

Super Produkt, wie beschrieben,  unsere Tochter ist total begeistert

Excellent

Il regalo è stato apprezzato.Ricevente bimba di 10 anni.

Wir haben die Bälle als Mitgebsel geplant für den Kindergeburtstag unseres Sohnes. Schleim etc kommt immer gut an. Allerdings riechen die so streng dass wir sie doch nicht nehmen werden. Aussehen tun sie schön, allerdings wirklich nichts für Kinder ab 6 sondern eher älter

Went off and smelt bad

Reinste katherstrophe!Der slime in den Bällen ist absoluter Müll, klumpig und nicht dehnbar wie angegeben. Es ist eine Frechheit finde ich..Zumal das Design von innen als adventskalender so keinen Sinn macht. Es liegen einfach 24 unkreative fast 1 zu 1 gleich befüllte Bälle neben einander.Wandert in den Müll. 25€ für nichts!

Las he comprado para la fiesta de cumple de mi hoja y les ha encantado a todos...Recomiendo!

Preis-Leistung- superdanke, immer wieder gerne

Eine Katastrophe!!!!Hat mit slime nichts zu tun. Es lässt sich nicht ziehen, die Kinder waren enttäuscht! Habe welche verschenkt darum kann ich es auch nicht mehr Retoure schicken.Fake

Lo slime purtroppo sembra andato a male, si presenta bene nelle ball con tanti colori vivaci, peccato che una volta aperto invece di allungarsi si spezza in tanti pezzetti e anche scaldato un po nelle mani il risultato non cambia.Mia figlia ci è rimasta male, per fortuna c’è il reso amazon e a breve gliene prenderò un atro di un altra marca.

Leider kam die Packung geöffnet und mit nur 12 Kugeln an- geht direkt zurück. Gemäss Beschreibung ( und wie die Packung aussieht) sollten 24 Kugeln enthalten sein.

Fun fun fun.

sono scarti, una truffa sono scarti, una vera truffa VERGOGNABRUTTI, SCURI E INREGALABILI.

Mein Sohn 4 - war sehr begeistert...ich weniger. Es war für einen Nachmittag interessant und dann war das Thema erledigt. Die einzelnen Kugeln sind aus leicht zerbrechlichen Plastik - fast alle waren gleich beschädigt und damit unbrauchbar. Auch der Geruch war unangenehm und chemisch.

Sieht super aus, riecht geil.Aber reißt viel zu leicht. Man hat nicht das Gefühl, dass es sich um Schleim handelt.Vielmehr, dass man eine recht fragile Massen ind en Händen hält.Nicht geil.

Der Artikel entspricht der Beschreibung.

Les pâtes sont desséchées dans les boules... Et pour cause, la date de péremption est largement dépassée : 01.06.2020 !!Pour un cadeau de Noël, très décevant....

This item is no good to me as it's out of date as the Expiration Date is 2020-06-01

Ideal für kinder. Verschiedene Farben.

Ce n'est pas du slime

schnelle lieferung bin zufrieden

Slime molto simpatici

Ok

ich glaube das ist giftig, es stinkt - KIndern würde ich es nicht geben. Trotzdem war es ganz lustig damit rumzuspielen.

hab mich von einigen Bewertungen beeinflussen lassen, war enttäuscht, sehen nicht so toll aus, eher unscheinbar und unspektakulär, keine besondere Überraschung

Leider nichts für unsere Kinds! Diese Schleim Kugeln stinken sehr nach Chemie u u hinterlassen ein ungutes Gefühl auf der Haut! Ging zurück!

Doesn't stretch just breaks very disappointing

Macht kein Spaß kinder

Perfetti per ringraziare gli amici di mia figlia che hanno partecipato al suo compleanno...profumano, non puzzano!Ottimo acquisto...

il regalo peggiore che potessi fare... tutti gli slime si rompevano subito! Meno male che Amazon, al solito, non ha battuto ciglio nella restituzoione.... peccato per la delusione di mia figlia. Sconsiglio assolutamente

Don't waste your time and money not worth 10 pounds box was used plz don't buy

Die Inhalte sind leider zu schnell ausgetrocknet nach mehrfachen gebrauch

Idea molto carina come regalino di fine festa di compleanno... i bambini erano molto entusiasti. Si presenta bene

Le ho prese come regalino da dare agli amichetti della mia bimba per il suo compleanno. Sono molto carine.

Comprati per dare un pensierino alla fine compleanno. Belli e qualità ottima, soprattutto perché non macchiano!!!!!!Molto soddisfatta

Carini divertenti hanno un buon odore e non sporcano alle mie figlie sono piaciute un sacco

Orrendi di slime non hanno nulla non sono elastici per niente si spezzano subito, una grande delusione per i bambini e per me che ho buttato i soldi in un articolo pessimo.

Poco elastici. Non si allungano per nulla, si spezzano in pezzi microscopici.Molto male.

HalloÜberhaupt nicht elastisch.

Malísimos. Esto no es slime ni siquiera puedes tocarlo se hace trozos al momento. Una pena porque es dinero tirado. No merece ni una estrella.

Die Packung war bereits auf und hier wird es dann als Neuware verkauft. Sowas geht garnicht

A mia figlia sono piaciuti  un sacco...troppo belli e fatti veramente  bene

Der Schleim, fing an zu stinken nach nur 3 Tagen, meine Tochter ist sehr enttäuscht.

No lo recomiendo, aparentemente muy bonito por los colores, pero el slime está todo duro, se rompe, no se estira y entonces no puedes jugar con el.

Molto carine le palline. Perfette per una fine festa di compleanno.

Slime,consegnata scatola ,palline troppo carine..

Carinissime, regalini di fine festa compleanno i bambini di 6 anni felicissimi! Splendide!

Estupendo

Haben uns die Kugeln viel größer vorgestellt

Unbrauchbarer schleim, zudem war die Packung nicht vollständig

No buono

Bellissimo regalino di fine festa. Molto apprezzato.

Der Schleim fing nach einer Woche an zu schimmeln

Schifezza

Tutto perfetto

KUGELN KAPUTT

Pessimo. Lo Slime si rompe e sbriciola. Sembra vecchio.

Ideal para regalitos de invitadosa cumpleaños

Molto belline, i bambini impazziti all'idea.

Buon prodotto.

CONFEZIONARE REGALI PER FESTA COMPLEANNO.

Ok.³

Mala calidad

Ok

Schlechte Geruch

Got this for my daughter as she really loves slime and was super excited when this arrived.It came as a large set of 24 slime balls with all different colours and variety, 6 of the balls came with Lovely bits in them and the rest were a beautiful galaxy colour mix.Each ball was a perfect size for my 5 year olds hand, the texture had a gooey feel in between slime and putty.Really liked that it wasn't too wet and sticky, and the slime can easily be put back in to the ball so it doesn't dry out and she can a carry around a few with her when we go out without taking too much space.

Meine Nichte steht sehr auf Schleim und um sie zu überraschen habe ich den gekauft. Ich war fasziniert von den Farben und wollte ihn auch gern ausprobieren. Vorstellung und Realität unterscheiden sich hier sehr, wie bei der Schlange. Ich hatte angenommen es ist feucht und glitschig aber ganz im Gegenteil. Es ist wie Gel in grellen Farben. Neben den Planeten gibt es auch Kugeln mit sehr hellem Schleim, dafür sind kleine Teilchen drin. Ich find die Erfindung wirklich super und das Kind war begeistert :)

Offert à ma petite-fille pour un calendrier de l'Avent (Une boule chaque jour jusqu'à Noël). La présentation est super et a bcp plu à ma petite-fille (11ans). Le Slime, comme chacun sait a ses inconvénients, celui-ci n'y échappe pas, j'en ai trouvé collé sur les draps et c'est difficile à détacher...

Ich hab die kleinen Schleimkugeln als Weihnachtsgeschenke an meine Vereinskinder verschenkt. Sie kamen super an! "Guck mal, die glitzern!" "Und da sind kleine Sachen drin!" Lediglich elastischer hätte ich sie erwartet.

Seems good deal but price went up after I last purchase, too bad . Have to find something else

You get many slimes, which is perfect for loot bags. However, they are very small and not much slime. Not a bad purchase but if I knew they would be this small, would have maybe considered something else.

Nicht zufrieden

Tut was es soll und wofür es ist.Gute Qualität und gutes Preis / Leistungsverhältnis.Gerne wieder.

Los compré para regalar a los compis de cole.Les gusto mucho. Ideal si quieres dar un detallito

Le ho usate come regalino da dare alle bimbe per il compleanno di mia figlia seguito giochini fatti, erano il premio. Hanno avuto un successo super

Très belle qualité et doux au toucher.  Se remet facilement dans son contenants et reprend sa forme

"The media could not be loaded.The galaxy slime comes in very tiny containers that are suitable for party favours only. The slime itself feels like mucous lol, the kids were kind of grossed out by it. Overall I feel like the product is overpriced."

These slimes are incredibly good, their consistency is great, no residues all over... The colours were fun for the kids and the ones with the charms were lots of fun! They stretch well with some massaging just as indicated in the pack, will have them in mind for other birthdays... They were a hit! My kids and friends love them!

Le sfere sono piccolette, lo slime e morbido ma non appiccica molto, ottimo perché non sorca gli abiti e si recupera bene. Alcune sfere hanno all'interno perline o animaletti, che piacciono alle bimbe. I colori sono vivaci e simpatici, prevalentemente sul blu e verde, ma anche rosa e arancio. Io le ho comprate come pensierino per i bimbi invitati alla festa di compleanno di mia figlia, avevano tutti tra 5 e 8 anni, e hanno apprezzato. Il prezzo è contenuto per il numero di perle presenti nella scatola: confezionate in una bella scatolina rettangolare colorata

The colours are really cool but the quality of the slime sucks. There’s no stretch and once it breaks apart it doesn’t go back together. Then you get these tiny pieces of slime everywhere. I won’t buy again. Wish I could return it but opened a few containers already. Do not recommend.

Ho acquistato queste palline per aggiungerle alla gift box di fine festa per gli amichetti di mio figlio.  Nonostante alcune recensioni negative sulla consistenza dello slime,  ho rischiato, le ho scelte perché sembrano dei piccoli pianeti e sembravano perfette per il tema Spazio che avevamo scelto. Beh, siamo stati fortunati perché, oltre che davvero molto carine, lo slime all’interno aveva un’elasticità è una consistenza perfette.

Ich habe diese Schleimkugeln für meine Tochter bestellt. Sie hat sich sehr darüber gefreut. Gut finde ich, dass es einzelne Kugeln sind und man nicht auf einmal einen riesen Schleimbatzen hat. So kann man immer mal eine Kugel öffnen und den " Schleim" nachdem Spielen wieder in der Kugel verstauen. Er sieht auch sehr schön aus und hat teilweise kleine Figuren drin. Was nicht so toll ist, dass er etwas chemisch riecht und man den Schleim leider nicht so ziehen kann, wie beschrieben. Er ist relativ fest und bricht schnell auseinander. Er klebt auch super auf Teppichen u.ä. Also hier aufpassen!

Der Slime reißt leicht, damit tut er nicht was zu erwarten ist. Und er riecht stark nach Chemie. Daher nicht empfehlenswert.Nette Farben immerhin.

The price is a little high for the size

Il prodotto sembra vecchio, poco elastico, non è come il classico slime. Non ho fatto il reso solo perché mia figlia l'aveva già visto e ha voluto subito giocarci. Non si sbriciola ma ha la consistenza della plastilina e non degli slime. Saró stato io sfortunato... Non consiglio l'acquisto.

Die Kinder haben sich sehr über die Bälle gefreut. Einige wenige Bälle hatten kleine Perlen im Schleim. Sie wurdem am Kindergeburtstag verteilt. Leider ist der Schleim aber alles andere als Fluffy und der Geruch ist auch nicht der beste. Die Konsistenz erinnert eher an Knete und er bröckelt recht schnell.

Un producto que me ha sorprendido, usado en fiesta infantil y los niños encantados, las bolas eran mas grandes de lo que me imaginaba, no son enormes pero estan bastante bien de tamaño. Recomendado sin duda como regalo de fiesta.

Wir haben diese Kugeln als Giveaways für den Kindergeburtstag meiner 8 jährigen Rochter gekauft. Alle fanden es super.

Beautiful colours

Wide assortment keeps my child busy

I ordered this for my (almost) 3 year old daughter who LOVES slime. She was SO excited to open the pack and see 24 little tubs of slime, and immediately grabbed 4 tubs to open. As soon as she took the first one out of the package a piece fell off. She was in near tears and she "broke" the slime.  We grabbed another tub and when she tried to stretch the slime, it just ripped off. If she squeezed it, it broke into a million pieces, and she got tiny little globs of slime everywhere. She was so disappointed.  I recall reading some decently positive reviews, so I scrolled through and found a review that says you just have to work it in.  So I grabbed the slime from her, and "kneaded" the slime for 15 minutes.  Not only was it now in a million pieces all over my floor, my hands were covered in the galaxy slime, and it looks like something my dog would have thrown up. If you leave it to "rest", it all comes back together and has a nice sparkle to it.  So it's a nice "look but don't touch" slime... but who gets slime to just look at??I guess the positive side of the slime is that it looks pretty, so good to gift away, because it's not something I would want in my house.

Nicht gut

Comprate come regalino per gli invitati ad una festa di compleanno, le palline sono veramente carine e ben fatte. Lo slime all'interno non fa cattivo odore e non sporca né macchia, non si sbriciola né si attacca ai vestiti. Le consiglio

Per il prezzo speso vanno più che bene. Sono come delle palline di ping pong. Si aprono e dentro c'è lo slime. Non è elastico al massimo ma ha dei bei colori..

Idée cadeau pour ma fille mais convient mieux pour un cadeau de kermesse Etc .. car il y a 24 petites balles avec un slime dedans , il y a des couleurs différentes mais bon pour la même personne ça n’est pas utile d’avoir 24 boules

Consegna puntuale,i 24pezzi sono variegati ,non troppo colorati,ma con alcuni pezzi (4/5) più  da femmina con glitter,paperelle,fiorellini. Ideali per me che devo impacchettarli insieme ad alcune caramelle come regalino post party. La dimensione è più o meno di una pallina da ping-pong. Le parole del mio bimbo quasi cinquenne:<< lo slime è perfetto,non appiccica,brilla e profuma di sole 😅>>

I was very disappointed as these slimes were hard when they were received. You could kind of stretch them but they would break. It definitely did not have the texture of slime that I was expecting.

Wir haben den Schleim als Mitgebsel/Beschäftigung zum Schulanfang gekauft. Er ist in kleinen Plastikkugeln verpackt, diese liegen in einem Karton mit Platzhaltern. Die Farben sind schön. Der Schleim riecht nicht und klebt nicht, hinterlässt keine Schleimdpuren auf Tisch ect.. Wenn er geknetet wird, wird er etwas fester und kann als Kugel auch springen. Man kann ihn zerteilen und er fügt sich schnell wieder zu einer Masse zusammen.Die leeren Kugeln gehen leider etwas schnell kaputt. Wir haben dann in Plastikeier umgepackt. Auch nach 3 Monaten ist der offene Schleim noch top.Es hatten nicht nur die Kinder Spaß. ;)Ich würde ihn auch nochmal kaufen.

Do not buy this productThe slime is low quality it breaks apart and makes a mess all over the houseThe slime also comes on tiny shot glass cups not as advertised.

Hallo,Wir haben es für unsere Tochter zum Geburtstag bestellt.Es ist vollständig und unbeschadet bei uns angekommen.Es ist bei unsere Tochter und den anderen Kindern ( Geschwister und Gäste) sehr gut angekommen. Auch wir Erwachsenen konnten nicht die Finger davon lassen.Ich kenne noch den Gliebber von meiner Kindheit und der Geruch ( der schon etwas eigenwillig ist) hat mich sofort in meiner kindheitserinnerung versetzt.Minimal klebrig... Daher zu empfehlen es nicht auf Teppiche, decken, oder sandige Untergrund zu bespielen.Was sehr schön ist :Die FarbenGute einzelne Portionsgrössen ( zum teilen wichtig😉)Der extra Glipper in der untersten Reihe der durchsichtig ist und kleinere Gegenstände eingearbeitet ist..... machen das Set vollständig und lassen für uns keine spielwünsche offen.Das einzige was etwas schade ist:Der Gliebber ist ja in einzelne kreisrunde Plastikbehälter porzioniert ( was ja sehr schön ist) doch das Plastik ist sehr dünn und spröde.... Was zu Folge hat das es bei minimalen druck kaputt geht..... und somit die Aufbewahrung des Gliebber etwas schwieriger macht.Tip hier: Wir haben uns da mit leere ü-eier geholfenWir sind bis auf den kleinen Verpackungs sache sehr zufrieden und geben wegen dem spielspass und der Menge an Gliebber 5 SterneIch hoffe die Bewertung hilft euchLg

Stinken zwar chemisch,  macht sich dennoch in der Mitbringsel- Tüte gut.

Acquistati come gadget per la festa di compleanno del mio bambino di 6 anni.Il regalo è piaciuto molto ai bimbi che alle bimbe. Ci sono diverse varietà alcune palline sono glitterate altre invece contengono al loro interno piccoli oggetti come stelline, cuoricini o paperelle. Le palline sono un po’ piccole rispetto alle aspettative. In ogni caso fanno la loro bella figura

Ce n’est pas le type de slime qui se recolle si vous la séparer elle n’adhère plus ensemble et vite ça devient plein de petit morceau et ça fait beaucoup de dégât. En plus les pots sont minuscule.

Sono molto belli e il più importante è che non sono troppo mole e non si attaccano ai vestiti

If you try to stretch up you have to do it very slowly otherwise is going to break in parts, so for toddlers, I won't recommend, also you can't mix colours, so you have to play carefully with it if you want to keep all colours

Not stretchy at all and breaks easily

Es un slime bastante duro y las bolas son pequeñas, del tamaño de una pelota de Ping Pong. Por lo demás son muy bonitas y dos de ellas traen un pequeño muñequito

Kam super an als Gastgeschenke bei der Geburtstagsfeier meines Sohnes.

Non è slime, si spacca in tanti pezzi.Per quanto le palline siano carine, l’articolo è vecchio. Sicuramente non è uno slime.Restituito.

High quality slime, in hard wearing globe containers.Beautiful colours, with no ball looking exactly the same.Slime is easy to handle and not at all sticky, so not found clung to items everywhere!Only small criticism, is it might be nice to have a few of the random balls in  there, the o es with the added confetti etc, or themed slimes, but as it is called galaxy slime I suppose these ones will be less apparent!All in all a great buy and would buy again.

Habe ich für meine Schüler geholt, sie haben sich gefreut, war an sich alles in Ordnung aber ich finde das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis ein wenig unverhältnismäsig. Insgesamt ein wenig zu teuer, den Kindern gefällt es aber.

Ich habe die Kugeln als Mitgebsel zum Kindergeburtstag meiner 6- jährigen Tochter bestellt. Die Lieferung kam schnell und unbeschädigt an. Die Kugeln waren der Renner bei den Kindern. Sie kamen supergut an.Nach ein paar Tagen jedoch finde ich überall Klebespuren von den Schleimkugeln. In der Artikelbeschreibung steht, dass der Slime keine Klebespuren hinterlässt, doch das tut er definitiv! Auf Kissen und Kleidung und und und....Mit der normalen Wäsche ist es nicht rausgegangen, worüber ich mich jetzt im Nachhinein sehr ärgere.

Non sono buoni sono secchi e piccolissimi

Sehr gutes Material

Non è per niente elastico, si spezza e le palline sono piccolissime

Good

I bought the slime kit for my slime obsessed granddaughter , I wanted some thing different , unique gift and my granddaughter loved it , the slime is not sticky and the little gifts inside some of the pods is such an extra bonus !!! So pleased with this kit . Highly recommended

Ordered these as favours for my daughters birthday coming up in a couple days.  When I received the product, box was beat up a bit and half empty.  Returning immediately.  Re-bought because her heart was set on these, lets hope it doesn't happen again!

Rigolo ce slime dans les petites sphères  en plastique dommage que beaucoup de couleur se ressembleParfait pour un anniversaire

Acheté octobre pour un anniversaireTous allait bien au débutEt depuis on met petit à petit le slim à la poubelleIl mousse ça dégouline des boîtes il pue de plus en plusC'est immondePour le prix c'est cher

La cara de mi peque cuando los vió fue un poema. Es un pack perfecto para tener un detalle con los peques tras un cumple y no dar siempre la bolsa de chuches.Vienen 24 bolitas de plástico redondas, con diferentes colores de slime, algunos espaciales, otros transparentes y unos cuantos con alguna sorpresa dentro (minipatitos)El único pero es que hay que ir con cuidado, porque las manchas de este slime no se quitan, se endurecen en los tejidos cuando se secan y no hay manera humana de sacarlos.Y por tejidos me refiero a ropa y también a tapicerías de coche..Aún así, muy bonitos

Erster Eindruck süß und klein. Toll ist das jede galaxy noch einmal extra verpackt ist.Eine tolle Farbwahl, lebendige schöne Farben. Dann nach der ersten geöffneten galaxy wurde ich leider süchtig. Dachte ja weil Chinaware meist stinkt und Chemie und so.... Aber dieser Geruch von dem slime ist der hammer. Kennt ihr diese citronen Armbänder gegen mücken? So duftet der slime. Eine citronengalaxy. Wunderbar ist auch das der slime nicht an der Hand oder Kleidung klebt. Somit darf auch mal die jüngste (3 Jahre) mal mit slimen.

I was silly enough to ignore some bad reviews. Thinking there are just as many good ones!! Don’t be fooled.I purchased 2 sets one for my nieces & one for my daughter. Totally just shy of £35 for two sets........These “slimes” are no longer slime....... I believe at one point they would have been “slime” but clearly these have been stored in the wrong environment (that’s My guess due to them been so cold on opening tubes) & they have turned to gel that just tears apart.I was gutted for my 2 year old who’s taken a big liking to my nieces slime collection. These are stunning..... very pretty and eye catching......... but aren’t any good for kids to play with unless they like crumbling useless Gel.Thankfully I got my money back on both sets as I returned them as they aren’t fit for purpose for sure.

Le palline di slime sono piaciute tanto ai bambini a cui le abbiamo regalate per intrattenersi durante una festa di compleanno. Peccato purtroppo che i colori non rispecchino quelli delle foto, sono molto più spenti ma i bambini ci fanno meno caso di noi! Non si attaccano facilmente in giro e questo è un vantaggio, attenti solo a non pestarle...

Kind ist begeistert. Wir haben einen Adventskalender daraus gemacht. Der Schleim ist eine gute Qualität. Niedlich versehen mit kleinen Teilchen, wie Perlen und.s.w.. Gerne wieder.

I'm going to buy more! I bought them as party bag fillers and I love those! The slime smells nice and doesn't get sticky or dirty. It leaves a wet feeling on your hands that lasts a few seconds but no residue.  It is honestly the best slime I have found! And the galaxy balls really look amazing in colour.I really recommend!

These slime balls are great. They are more like a putty rather than slime, my girls are 3 & 8 and they love them.Perfect for little ones however there are some small bits & pieces in the 5 clear/colour slimes so I'd advise adult supervision if like my 3 year old, they like to put things in their mouth.

I have no idea why kids love these slimes so much, but I'm happy it gives so much joy to children. Good quality product and those slimes are very fun to play with as well. Your child won't be disappointed. :D

Dieser Artikel war nicht mehr als 5€ wert. Unverschämtheit, ihn derart teuer zu veräußern.Ich war erschrocken beim auspacken, als ich die Ware sah.Die Sterne gerne ich nur für die reibungslose und schnelle Abwicklung was die Rücksendung/Reklamation angeht

Sehr schön und gut , wieder gerne kaufen

Die Dinger sind ganz lustig. Auch richtig slimig scheint aber nicht zu kleckern.Leider kam es dazu, dass die Dinger nach ein paar Tagen im Döschen übelst gestunken haben. Richtig widerlich.

Nur nett anzusehen.Slime nicht wie man es kennt. Lässt sich nicht ziehen, reißt sofort und lässt sich dann nicht wieder zusammen kneten.  Geruch ist erträglich.Nach einiger Zeit nicht Nutzung wollte meine kleine wieder mit ihrem slime spielen, leider mit großer Enttäuschung. Slime hat wurde sehr flüssig, stank und war nur noch gut für die Mülltonne. Kommt Slime mit Decken, Kleidung, Teppich oder sonstiges aus Stoff in Berührung bekommt man es nur sehr mühsam entfernt oder garnicht.Werde es nicht wieder holen und würde es auch nicht weiterempfehlen.

Il prodotto è ottimo soprattutto se messo in paragone con alcuni Slime che esistono in commercio e che sono molto più pubblicizzati. Il prodotto Infatti non appiccica non incolla Ha un buon profumo I colori sono molto apprezzati dai bambini. Inoltre essendo in quantità così piccole richiudibili lo Slime non si secca e si può anche dilazionare il regalo nel tempo senza doverlo aprire tutto insieme.  assolutamente consigliato

Carinissime palline usate per prepare i gadget di fine festa. Ogni pallina ha un diametro di 3 cm circa. Non sono tutte brillantino se ma alcune sono trasparenti con pezzetti di frutta. Quindi le volete tutte dello stesso tema dovrete prendere più confezioni

Meilleur jeu de slime pour ma fille

Distrutto in poche ore dalla bambina. Poco resistente

Also, das Paket kam gerade an. Bin wirklich begeistert. Diese Slimekugel sehen wirklich toll aus. Habe mich mit der Bestellung ja etwas schwer getan weil es ja (nur) ein Gastgeschenk sein soll und ich es zusammen mit den anderen Dingen nicht zu teuer werden lassen wollte, aber es lohnt sich. Hier ist alles bombenfest. Nix läuft aus. Sieht absolut toll aus. Und sie haben eine wirklich ausreichende Grösse. Klar grösser geht immer aber im Preis Leistung gesehen .....Top.Wurde auch super schnell geliefert. Gestern bestellt, heute da.

Ich habe ein paar der Kugeln mit in die Überraschungstüten beim Kindergeburtstag getan. Die Freude war groß. Ich empfindet es allerdings mehr als Knete als Schleim. Und der Preis ist auch zu hoch. Trotzdem ein vielseitiges Spielzeug.

Ich habe diesen Galaxy Slime meiner Tochter zum Geburtstag gekauft leider ist es nicht wirklich ein Slime. Er reißt extrem schnell auch wenn er aufgewärmt ist und ist von der Beschaffenheit eher hart nicht schleimig so wie Slime eigentlich sein müsste.Meine Tochter hat trotzdem Spaß dran gefunden und das ist die Hauptsache.Aber kaufen würde ich Ihn nicht nochmal.

Enkel fahren voll drauf ab :-) Sind aber Besser als die großen Quetschkugeln. Finde aber die sehr kleinen Innereien der Kugeln nicht schön. Die größeren Innenteile gehen aber.

Ho acquistato queste palline come regalo di fine festa per il compleanno di mia figlia da distribuire ai suoi amichetti. Le palline di slime sono veramente molto carine e colorate. É stata mia figlia a sceglierle.

Kann noch nichts sagen, kommt in den Weihnachtskalender

im ersten Moment sieht es aus und fühlt es sich an wie man es sich vorstellt, doch beim kneten bricht der slime und bröckelt auseinander. sehr schade :/

Ich habe damit den Adventskalender meiner Tochter befüllt. Das ganze kam super an. Die einzelnen Kugeln gehen nur leider super schnell kaputt und dann schleimt alles voll.

Tanto apprezzato

ich persönlich mag die Kugeln gar nicht, da sie mir teilweise einfach viel zu glitschig sind. ich bevorzuge eher den Schleim, der zwar schleimig ist, aber nicht so extrem an den Fingern klebt, wie dieser. die Farben sind schön, aber der Rest ist nicht meins. würde es nicht nochmal kaufen.

Un juguete muy entretenido, comprado para jugarlo con mi sobrino, y al final me he divertido tanto como él.Se hace divertido ir abriendo cada bola e ir descubriendo los diferentes colores de cada uno.Algunas son más elásticas o más pegajosas que otras, van mejorando el tacto después de jugar un rato con ellas, ya que se van calentando.  Pasados unos días nos entró la curiosidad de mezclar algunas bolas y crear nuevos colores. Hay diversión para rato!

Würde unter Adventskalender angepriesen. 24 einzelne Kugeln mit Schleim, der beim ersten Ziehen reißt. Sehr enttäuschend

Confacente alle aspettative

Im großen und Ganzen super! Nur leider war eine der Slimekugeln in der Packung kaputt und ist ausgelaufen...somit ein ganz klein wenig Enttäuschung beim Kind. Ansonsten ist das Produkt toll und kommt gut an!

Salve,stupende e pratiche, ho preso queste palline di slime per mio figlio, sono rimasta prima io colpito dalla alta qualità del prodotto e dalla fatto di essere così vari colori e tipologie che non si stanca mai di giocare. come si vede in foto, sono colorate, trasparenti, con le perline, con le paparelle, tanti modelli e tanti modi di giocare che stiamo ormai giocando solo a questo. Poi lo slime è davvero un gioco carino e facile da fare che sono davvero soddisfatto da questo articolo. lo consiglio

Prodotto vecchio, secco

Slime un peu caoutchouc, ma facile a magner...mais ma fille reste quand même contente

Diese Knete ist richtig super, wir lieben sie, sie bleibt nicht kleben, man kann super damit spielen, auch die kleinen Obststücke und Entchen sind super süß. Einfach perfekt.

Bought as prizes for kid’s competition. Awesome little pockets of slime and sparkle.If you like that kind of thing.Which I don’t.But hey- doing it for the kids....they loved them.Their parent’s probably hate me.Modern day dilemma.

Tiene olor agradable, no se Mancha. Pero no es elástico. Colores bonitos. Lo he comprado para la piñata. Es juguete para una fiesta, para el uso continuo no sirve

Habe das Produkt  hier im Angebot  gekauftIch muss  sagen  es ist toll  ist gut zum Geburtstag  angekommen

Alles super und ein tolles Mitgebsel

An sich ganz witzig aber viele gleiche Bälle. Größe ist perfekt und schleim ok.

I got these to help with toilet training my 5 year old autistic daughter .. she love slime and these are perfect for an award when she uses the toilet

La confezione sembra perfetta, tante palline colorate che invogliano al gioco. Se si apre la pallina però la delusione è grande, non è slime ma un sorta di plastilina che si rompe durante il gioco. Sconsiglio l'acquisto

Könnte mehr vielfältiger sein  . Sonst hat das Kind viel Spaß damit gehabt .

Dem Titel nach sollte es sich um einen Adventskalender handeln, nun ja es sind 24 Kugeln drinnen, stimmt, aber es ist einfach eine offene Box wo man sofort alle Kugeln sieht. Ohne Türchen, ohne Nummern, ohne Überraschung. Das ist sehr schade!

È  piaciuto molto perché ci sono tantissimi slime, certo non  molto filanti, ma cmq per un bambino appassionato va più che bene

Great for party bags!

Die Kugeln sind sweet, sie sind so klein das sie in einen Adventskalender passen. Für Kinder unter 6 Jahren allerdings nicht geeignet, es gibt Schleim der kleine Teile enthält und leicht zu verschlucken sind.

Ich habe als Adventskalender für meinen Sohn gekauft und er war sehr zufrieden

Alles Schick!

Se casse en pleins de petits morceaux et inutilisable

Es ist für ein Kindergeburtstag der Hit. Es ist aber nicht die beste Qualität. Es sind sehr schöne Farben. Der Schleim riecht aber ein bisschen komisch. Aber Kindern gefällt es.

They are tiny, not worth price.

tutto perfetto solo le dimensioni un pò contenute

Sehr schön, nur muss der Schleim richtig geknetet werden bevor man ihn ziehen kann. Riecht sehr chemisch...

Meine Kinder lieben Schleim und deshalb habe ich ihnen zum Kindertag dieses große Packung Schleimbälle bestellt. Es gibt 24 verschiedene Modelle, teilweise mit Figuren. Der Schleim leuchtet in den schönsten Farben. Wir bewahren den Schleim in den gelieferten Kugeln auf. Ein toller Spaß für Groß und Klein.

⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟Wir haben die Slimes als kleine Abschiedsgeschenke für die Geburtstagsparty unserer kleinen gekauft.Die Slimes sind einzeln in kleinen Kugel verpackt und noch zusätzlich verschweißt. Die Farbgestaltungen sindrichtig schön Galaxy-mäßig :-)Alle Kids sind happy und Slimy nach Hause gegangen.⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟⍟

It was really small and watery I wouldn’t recommend it for that price you pay

Simpatico ed ottimo per il regalino da donare  agli invitati di un compleanno , solo forse un po’ piccoli .

Article perimé depuis juin, donc slime sec...certaine boules dont le film protecteur est manquant donc déjà ouvert, des boules qui fuient, à moitié remplie, cassée, etc, etc, etc, on peut en supposer plein de choses, article qui a déjà été renvoyé mais qu'on propose quand même à d'autres clients? On sait jamais, sur un malentendu...J'ai voulu me fier au commentaires positifs, je n'aurai pas dû.. c'est tellement aléatoire finalement... j'ai joué j'ai perdu.C'était pour remplir le calendrier de l'avent de ma fille qui adooooore le slime, avec plein d'autre petites bricoles, 24 c'était parfait. Heureusement que je m'y prend tôt, mais je n'ai clairement pas envie de tenter l'expérience de nouveau, même avec un autre vendeur.Conclusion, 1 étoile par rapport à mon expérience.Encore une fois, c'est très aléatoire...

Prodotto molto apprezzato da mio figlio ...unica pecca e non da poco gli slime trasparenti ovvero quelli non metallizzati li ho dovuti buttare perché si appiccicavano alle mani in mille pezzi invece che rimanere un corpo unico rendendolo ingiocabile ....per quelli metallizzati tutto ok

Cadeau pour une fillette de 9 ans. Très satisfaite

Keine Ahnung wofür man sowas braucht, aber meine Tochter liebt es nunmal....sieht jedenfalls schön aus und klebt nicht an der Kleidung oder ähnlichem fest.

I bought these as party bag fillers, I expected them to be a decent size because of product images - but they were tiny. Party was a space theme so these were meant to fit that, by randomly 6 out of 24 were just pink glittery. So so overpriced, Tesco do a better version for a fraction of the cost.

Etwas schade das die Kugeln so lieb los verpackt sind aber sonst super kleben nicht und Schleimen auch nicht. Trotzdem super zum kneten und Formen

Un regalo con el que sorprendí a los peques! Mantiene la elasticidad incluso si se olvida una noche de cerrarlo!! Son geniales!

je suis très satisfaite de ce slime, en effet, il n'a pas de mauvaise odeur, il ne sèche pas vite et le conditionnement dans les petites boules est très pratique pour le partager avec plusieurs enfants. les couleurs sont jolies et scintillantes

Meine Tochter mag den Slime gerne. Die Farben sind schön, er klebt nicht an den Händen und riecht nicht so intensiv wie vergleichbare Produkte

Sono piaciuti tantissimo, fatti bene, non incollano, sembrano tutti uguali ma in realtà sono diversi e comunque tanti, quindi bellissimi come regalo!

Purtroppo appiccica. Sono pochi che non appiccicano (i crystal). Pero almeno si pulisce in fretta da qualsiasi superficie o supporto..

Mein Sohn freut sich darüber in seinem Adventskalender... allerdings befinden sich darin kleine Glasscherben. Das ist gefährlich und sollte so nicht verkauft werden.

No es exactamente slime (no es tan estirable), pero a cambio no mancha ni es pegajoso. Los colores muy bonitos, y el tamaño de las bolas es más grande de lo que esperábamos. Muy bien por lo que cuesta

Bastante entretenido, sin embargo, algo si queanchan, y algunas de las jelly's de la caja estaban pasadas y algo duras. De hecho es cierto que si las trabajas se reblandece, pero algunas ni a tiros, estaba secas y se partian

"The media could not be loaded.

 Ich habe den slime gekauft als Gastgeschenk für einen Kinder Geburtstag.Ich bin sehr begeistert von diesem slim.Er ist vom Geruch sehr angenehm.Man kann ihn auseinander reißen und er geht ohne Probleme wieder zusammen kneten.Die Farben und das Glitzer ist mega schön.Die Kinder waren begeistert."

Sehr kleine Schleime in Kugeln. Der Schleim riecht sehr streng und ist teil gar nicht so schleimig und dehnbar.Waren für die Mitgebtüten zu einem Kindergeburtstag.

Produkt ist top, die Kinder haben sich gefreut

hay que tocarlas mucho para que sean slime..pero tienen unos colores muy bonitos.Eran para regalo y nos las hemos quedado...con éso digo todo..jeje

Regalato alla mia bimba di 5 anni che è rimasta più che contenta....bella l'idea di separare lo Slime in 24 palline tutte coloratissime ...ottimo anche il prodotto che non risulta appiccicoso come altri Slime di diverse marche ...facile da riarotolare e conservare nelle apposite palline di plastica che ne conservano la consistenza anche dopo diversi giorni.. consigliatissimo!!

Les enfants ont étaient ravie de découvrir le slime galaxy Ball.Moi aussi aucune odeur 24 couleurs différentes aucun danger pour les enfants.Très simple d utilisation alors si vous voulez faire plaisir aux enfants n hésitez pas le cadeau parfais.

Super slime...Verklebt nicht, die Kinder haben eine Freude

Tolles Geschenk, meine Tochter (9) liebt Schleim und dieser Schleim riecht gut und ist von der Konsistenz genau richtig,bleibt nicht kleben und zum kneten gut geeignet. Würde ich wieder kaufen.

Der Versand war wie gewohnt schnell, leider war der Karton leicht zerdrückt. Als mitgebsel auf den Kindergeburtstag kam es gut an. Würde den aber nicht nochmal bestellen.

God child liked this, personally think a little over priced

Gerne wieder

Ich habe es meine Tochter geschenkt die Freude war riesig, mir war wichtig das der slime nicht klebt und das tut er auch nicht! Super Geschenk auch zum verschenken. Wirklich tolle slimes!

Absolut unbrauchbarLeider!Habe eben erst beim Befüllen des Adventskalenders bemerkt, dass der Schleim alles andere als schleimig ist. Er ist extrem krümlig und auch durch längeres kneten und wärmen wird es nicht besser. Wenn ich es eher geprüft hätte hätte ich sofort reklamiert so bin ich leider über der Zeit...absoluter Fehlkauf

Bin etwas enttäuscht, da der Karton verbeult war, als wenn er schon ein paar mal benutzt wurde. Es soll ein Geschenk für meine 10 Jahre alte Enkelin sein. Hab es mir anders vorgestellt.

schnelle lieferung, paket war am 2. tag schon da. meine tochter kann stundenlang damit spielen. geruch an die finger ist angenehm, sehr leicht. schöne farbe. ist ein sauberer ersatz zu knete. super spiel zurzeit bei ausgangssperre.

usati come regalo per gli invitati alla festa di compleanno hanno riscosso tanto successo. Lo slime non puzza e resta elastico e umido anche dopo l'uso. Le palline che contengono il prodotto si rompono facimente. Alcuni slime contengono dei piccoli oggetti ( fruttini paperelle perline ) e li rendono ancora più interessanti per i bambini. CONSIGLIATO

Der Slime ist heute (05.01.2021) bei uns angekommen und laut Verpackung seit dem 06.01.2020 abgelaufen. Dementsprechend ist er ausgetrocknet und kein Slime mehr sondern mehr wie Knete.

Excellent service item arrived in two days from placing the order. Thank you

Leider war es nicht wie erwartet und auch nicht wie normaler Slime. Die Masse war eher mit weicher Knete zu vergleichen. Schade.

Leider waren nur 23 Stück drin statt 24...meine Tochter war enttäuscht

Es gab strahlende kinderaugen und es macht super viel spaß mit dem schleim zu spielen  :)  top  !

Also für mich ist es kein Schleim sondern eher Gelee! Es ist leider nicht so toll wie wir es gedacht haben.

Ich habe für meine Tochter einen Adventskalender gebastelt wo sie jeden Tag eine Schleimkugel hat. Wir haben heute den 5. Dezember und eine Schleimkugel ist schon hart die anderen fangen an zu stinken . Sie ist echt enttäuscht! Dafür ist der Preis einfach viel zu hoch . Wir können die Kugeln definitiv nicht weiter empfehlen !!!

Après plusieurs semaines d'utilisations,  hélas je suis obligée de retirer des étoiles,  comme un autre commentaire je suis au regret de dire que le slim s'abîme avec le temps, même les boules non ouvertes :-(  et une odeur apparaît je suis un donc un déçu par rapport a l'ouverture et les premières utilisations de ce dernier....

Die Flummi Slimes sind in Ordnung

Naja...

I bought this set of slime for my sons birthday, I can’t wait to see his face. The packaging is very neat and the colours of the slime look amazing!

Perfekt als Mitgebsel für jeden Kindergeburtstag. Kein geklebe oder rum gematsche

Además de parecerme muy pequeño, y si bien es cierto que es bonito y original no cumple su función. Los niños esperan elasticidad, que se deslice de manera viscosa y sin pegarse (esto último los padres...). Pues se rompe como si nada es como si fuese una plastilina pero no se moldea... No funciona... Una pena.

Nach einem Tag leider ausgetrocknet.Ist meiner Ansicht nach rausgeworfenes Geld,Auch wenn es sich erst super toll anfühlt.

Wir haben es als Geburtstagsmitgebsel für unseren 9 jährigen Sohn gekauft. Seine Freunde waren begeistert. Es hat eine angenehme Konsistenz un einen angenehmen Geruch. Wir können es nur weiterempfehlen.

Really good gift for my son, he is enjoying a lot! it's not as sticky as I thought yet seems. Would avoid carpets, hair and good clothes

Nicht individuell genug.Übel riechende.Lauft teilweise aus.Aber ein hinkuger für kleine Geschänke.

Beinhaltet 18 Kugeln Galaxy Slime und 6 Kugeln mit durchsichtigem Slime mit Deko (Perlen, Früchte und ein mit 2 Enten) die Galaxy Slime Kugeln enthalten ungefähr 27g Slime und die andere 22 bis 26g. Meine Tochter hat es sehr gut gefallen. Zum weiterempfehlen.

Tutto ok!grazie

My son loved them even though we thought it was a advent calendar

Bimbi felici

Lo slime da vedere é molto bello una volta aperte le palline però il contenuto é poco elastico rispetto ad altri slime in commercio.

So ist das Produkt gut aber die Verpackung total verdrückt und gerissen!!

Regalo perfecto para los más peques, no mancha ni se pega en ropa ni superficies, ideal, además trae una gran variedad para más diversión.Mis niñas están encantadas!!!

Super Produkt

Come da foto. Ok

Alla fine sono più o meno dello stesso colore a parte quelle trasparenti

The slime was very bad ,it ripped a lot and was not good to play with , I would not get this and my husband, daughters , and cousins agree .

"The media could not be loaded.

 Really disappointed with this product, nothing like the description, very brittle and not in the least bit stretchy. I want a full refund!"

Un producto estupendo. Al peque le ha encantado. La caja es fuerte y una presentación muy bonita. Montones de slime con mini figuritas dentro. Súper chulo, sin duda compraré otro para regalo.

Als Geburtstagsgeschenk für meine Hortkinder auf Arbeit kamen sie gut an...

Funktioniert irgendwie so gar nicht... Ziehen wie Schleim geht nicht, denn dann reist der Schleim sofort auseiander... Schade

Not opened any of the balls yet but product looks amazing

Wir haben die Schleimkugeln als Mitgebsel für den Kindergeburtstag gekauft.. Kam gut an.. Im Schleim sind ganz kleine Sachen versteckt.. Blümchen, Sterne...

Ho comprato il kit per avere a disposizione dei regalini da dare a fine festa. Le palline erano ben confezionate, lo slime (all'interno) è morbido, si allunga moltissimo e non appiccica. Tutto perfettamente corrispondente alla descrizione. Consiglio l'acquisto

Anche io do 5 stelle a questo prodotto. Non sporca, anzi si manipola benissimo e ha un buonissimo profumo.18 sfere contengono slime metallizzato mentre le altre 6 sono leggermente colorate con all'interno delle perline.Consiglio vivamente l'acquisto.

Es ist kein Kalender! Es sind 24 Slimes in Plastikkugeln.Teils riecht der Slime stark parfümiert und fängt nach ein paar Tagen ganz extrem an zu riechen - sehr chemisch, beissend.

Super slim. Très jolies boules!

Simpatico presente per fine compleanno

Geniales Mitgebsel für den Kindergeburtstag unserer Tochter. Die Kinder waren begeistert. Schleim ist bei Kindern, warum auch immer, der absolute Hit.

Una idea genial para jugar entre varios niños

Pacco arrivato puntuale, lo slime all’interno delle sfere è ottimo finalmente ho risentito l’odore del vecchio slime... il primo di colore verde per intenderci. Molle quanto basta si gioca correttamente, al momento sono rimaste tutte morbide ed umide le sfere aperte

Está bien para detalle de cumpleaños

Absolute waste of time, nothing like pictures, it just broke in half and all the little beads bell out, I noticed it was really cold so either where it’s been stored has made it defective, or out of date, the label in it had spelling mistakes, I was so dissapointed bought for my daughters birthday good job I decided to open one of the balls to check it, I wouldn’t of wanted to see her upset.

Le ha chiflado a mi hijo de 5 años

Looks good but unfortunately the price tag doesn't match the quality. No matter how much you move it around and warm it up it just rips into chunks. Frustrated mum.

le palline di stime sono coloratissime e diverse tra loro. si adattano sia a bambini che bambine. ogni pallina e singolarmente sigillata

Carino il packaging,  ma a parte quelli trasparenti con gli oggetti dentro, sono tutti dello stesso colore, mio figlio è rimasto deluso

Die Kugeln können, sobald man sie geöffnet hat, nicht wieder verschlossen werden. Somit trocknet der Schleim nach dem ersten Benutzen aus und kann nur noch weggeschmissen werden. Leider nur ein sehr kurzer Spaß für die Kinder.

Bello come in foto

In der Beschreibung und auf der Verpackung steht 24 Stück Inhalt, als es geöffnet wurde waren aber 7 Felder leer und nur 17 Stück enthalten! Warum? War ziemlich peinlich weil es von uns verschenkt wurde!

Wer an Schleim denkt, sollte die Finger von dem Produkt lassen.Da zieht sich gar nichts, sondern bricht.

Macht sehr Spaß damit zu kneten :-) gefällt uns gut

Leider sind meine Slimes wie in anderen Rezensionen auch ebenfalls vor einem Jahr abgelaufen.. das merkt man auch an der Qualität,  sie sehen zwar hübsch auch, sind aber nicht mehr elastisch und auch zu hart.... reißen, wenn man sie außeinander zieht:(Schade!

Hätte mir mehr versprochen, das Set geht zurück! Der Schleim ist nicht zäh sondern reißt und bricht!

"The media could not be loaded.

 Der Slime ist heute (05.01.2021) bei uns angekommen und laut Verpackung seit dem 07.01.2020 abgelaufen. Dementsprechend ist er ausgetrocknet und kein Slime mehr sondern mehr wie Knete."

Offert en cadeau de départ lors de l'anniversaire de ma fille, les enfants étaient vraiment ravis. Merci

Llego rápido y en perfectas condiciones. Lo use para regalar y a los peques les encanto.Lo que más les ha gustado son los animalitos, bolitas y demás cositas que trae el slime dentro.

Super Produkt, wie beschrieben,  unsere Tochter ist total begeistert

Excellent

Il regalo è stato apprezzato.Ricevente bimba di 10 anni.

Wir haben die Bälle als Mitgebsel geplant für den Kindergeburtstag unseres Sohnes. Schleim etc kommt immer gut an. Allerdings riechen die so streng dass wir sie doch nicht nehmen werden. Aussehen tun sie schön, allerdings wirklich nichts für Kinder ab 6 sondern eher älter

Went off and smelt bad

Reinste katherstrophe!Der slime in den Bällen ist absoluter Müll, klumpig und nicht dehnbar wie angegeben. Es ist eine Frechheit finde ich..Zumal das Design von innen als adventskalender so keinen Sinn macht. Es liegen einfach 24 unkreative fast 1 zu 1 gleich befüllte Bälle neben einander.Wandert in den Müll. 25€ für nichts!

Las he comprado para la fiesta de cumple de mi hoja y les ha encantado a todos...Recomiendo!

Preis-Leistung- superdanke, immer wieder gerne

Eine Katastrophe!!!!Hat mit slime nichts zu tun. Es lässt sich nicht ziehen, die Kinder waren enttäuscht! Habe welche verschenkt darum kann ich es auch nicht mehr Retoure schicken.Fake

Lo slime purtroppo sembra andato a male, si presenta bene nelle ball con tanti colori vivaci, peccato che una volta aperto invece di allungarsi si spezza in tanti pezzetti e anche scaldato un po nelle mani il risultato non cambia.Mia figlia ci è rimasta male, per fortuna c’è il reso amazon e a breve gliene prenderò un atro di un altra marca.

Leider kam die Packung geöffnet und mit nur 12 Kugeln an- geht direkt zurück. Gemäss Beschreibung ( und wie die Packung aussieht) sollten 24 Kugeln enthalten sein.

Fun fun fun.

sono scarti, una truffa sono scarti, una vera truffa VERGOGNABRUTTI, SCURI E INREGALABILI.

Mein Sohn 4 - war sehr begeistert...ich weniger. Es war für einen Nachmittag interessant und dann war das Thema erledigt. Die einzelnen Kugeln sind aus leicht zerbrechlichen Plastik - fast alle waren gleich beschädigt und damit unbrauchbar. Auch der Geruch war unangenehm und chemisch.

Sieht super aus, riecht geil.Aber reißt viel zu leicht. Man hat nicht das Gefühl, dass es sich um Schleim handelt.Vielmehr, dass man eine recht fragile Massen ind en Händen hält.Nicht geil.

Der Artikel entspricht der Beschreibung.

Les pâtes sont desséchées dans les boules... Et pour cause, la date de péremption est largement dépassée : 01.06.2020 !!Pour un cadeau de Noël, très décevant....

This item is no good to me as it's out of date as the Expiration Date is 2020-06-01

Ideal für kinder. Verschiedene Farben.

Ce n'est pas du slime

schnelle lieferung bin zufrieden

Slime molto simpatici

Ok

ich glaube das ist giftig, es stinkt - KIndern würde ich es nicht geben. Trotzdem war es ganz lustig damit rumzuspielen.

hab mich von einigen Bewertungen beeinflussen lassen, war enttäuscht, sehen nicht so toll aus, eher unscheinbar und unspektakulär, keine besondere Überraschung

Leider nichts für unsere Kinds! Diese Schleim Kugeln stinken sehr nach Chemie u u hinterlassen ein ungutes Gefühl auf der Haut! Ging zurück!

Doesn't stretch just breaks very disappointing

Macht kein Spaß kinder

Perfetti per ringraziare gli amici di mia figlia che hanno partecipato al suo compleanno...profumano, non puzzano!Ottimo acquisto...

il regalo peggiore che potessi fare... tutti gli slime si rompevano subito! Meno male che Amazon, al solito, non ha battuto ciglio nella restituzoione.... peccato per la delusione di mia figlia. Sconsiglio assolutamente

Don't waste your time and money not worth 10 pounds box was used plz don't buy

Die Inhalte sind leider zu schnell ausgetrocknet nach mehrfachen gebrauch

Idea molto carina come regalino di fine festa di compleanno... i bambini erano molto entusiasti. Si presenta bene

Le ho prese come regalino da dare agli amichetti della mia bimba per il suo compleanno. Sono molto carine.

Comprati per dare un pensierino alla fine compleanno. Belli e qualità ottima, soprattutto perché non macchiano!!!!!!Molto soddisfatta

Carini divertenti hanno un buon odore e non sporcano alle mie figlie sono piaciute un sacco

Orrendi di slime non hanno nulla non sono elastici per niente si spezzano subito, una grande delusione per i bambini e per me che ho buttato i soldi in un articolo pessimo.

Poco elastici. Non si allungano per nulla, si spezzano in pezzi microscopici.Molto male.

HalloÜberhaupt nicht elastisch.

Malísimos. Esto no es slime ni siquiera puedes tocarlo se hace trozos al momento. Una pena porque es dinero tirado. No merece ni una estrella.

Die Packung war bereits auf und hier wird es dann als Neuware verkauft. Sowas geht garnicht

A mia figlia sono piaciuti  un sacco...troppo belli e fatti veramente  bene

Der Schleim, fing an zu stinken nach nur 3 Tagen, meine Tochter ist sehr enttäuscht.

No lo recomiendo, aparentemente muy bonito por los colores, pero el slime está todo duro, se rompe, no se estira y entonces no puedes jugar con el.

Molto carine le palline. Perfette per una fine festa di compleanno.

Slime,consegnata scatola ,palline troppo carine..

Carinissime, regalini di fine festa compleanno i bambini di 6 anni felicissimi! Splendide!

Estupendo

Haben uns die Kugeln viel größer vorgestellt

Unbrauchbarer schleim, zudem war die Packung nicht vollständig

No buono

Bellissimo regalino di fine festa. Molto apprezzato.

Der Schleim fing nach einer Woche an zu schimmeln

Schifezza

Tutto perfetto

KUGELN KAPUTT

Pessimo. Lo Slime si rompe e sbriciola. Sembra vecchio.

Ideal para regalitos de invitadosa cumpleaños

Molto belline, i bambini impazziti all'idea.

Buon prodotto.

CONFEZIONARE REGALI PER FESTA COMPLEANNO.

Ok.³

Mala calidad

Ok

Schlechte Geruch

Got this for my daughter as she really loves slime and was super excited when this arrived.It came as a large set of 24 slime balls with all different colours and variety, 6 of the balls came with Lovely bits in them and the rest were a beautiful galaxy colour mix.Each ball was a perfect size for my 5 year olds hand, the texture had a gooey feel in between slime and putty.Really liked that it wasn't too wet and sticky, and the slime can easily be put back in to the ball so it doesn't dry out and she can a carry around a few with her when we go out without taking too much space.

Meine Nichte steht sehr auf Schleim und um sie zu überraschen habe ich den gekauft. Ich war fasziniert von den Farben und wollte ihn auch gern ausprobieren. Vorstellung und Realität unterscheiden sich hier sehr, wie bei der Schlange. Ich hatte angenommen es ist feucht und glitschig aber ganz im Gegenteil. Es ist wie Gel in grellen Farben. Neben den Planeten gibt es auch Kugeln mit sehr hellem Schleim, dafür sind kleine Teilchen drin. Ich find die Erfindung wirklich super und das Kind war begeistert :)

Excelente producto
